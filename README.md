### Surrealist Megalophobia Video Prompt with Detailed Scene Breakdown

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A highly detailed, scene-by-scene prompt for generating a 15-second surrealist video with a megalophobia theme, featuring Hollywood-level special effects and realistic lighting. The narrative involves a giant zipper opening the sky to reveal a cyberpunk world, culminating in the revelation that the entire world is a miniature glass globe observed by a giant.

```
[Style] Surrealism, Megalophobia, Epic visual spectacle, Hollywood special effects quality, extremely realistic lighting rendering.
[Duration] 15 seconds
[Scene] A clear city sky, or an open wheat field.

[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: The Illusion of Calm (The Calm).
The screen shows a beautiful, cloudless blue sky, bright sunshine, and birds flying by. The camera slowly pans upward, giving a sense of peaceful time.
Key Detail: Suddenly, a huge, silver, metallic sheen appears in the sky—a **“zipper”** running across the horizon.

[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: The Zipper Opens (The Unzipping).
A **giant, translucent Hand of God** grips the zipper pull and slowly unzips the blue sky, accompanied by a huge roaring sound (sound effect).
Action: As the zipper opens, the “blue sky” wrinkles and droops like fabric.
Visual Spectacle: What is revealed behind the zipper is **not space**, but a **cyberpunk future world filled with neon lights, flying cars, and giant mechanical structures** (or a giant mechanical eyeball is watching us).

[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: The Gaze of Two Worlds (The Revelation).
Only a corner of the blue sky remains hanging. It turns out that the world we live in is just a covered “terrarium.”
Ending: The camera quickly pulls back, revealing that our entire world (city/wheat field) is actually just a **glass miniature landscape globe** on a giant's table. The giant leans in to observe us.
```

### Eastern Wuxia Ultimate Showdown with Extreme Kinetic Energy

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, three-scene prompt for a 15-second video depicting an ultimate Eastern Wuxia duel between a master in white and a master in black. It specifies 'Extreme Kinetic Energy,' 'Environmental Destruction Aesthetics,' fast-paced editing, cinematic particle effects, and an epic soundtrack, detailing the collision, mid-air combat, and a final energy blast climax.

```
[Style] Eastern Wuxia ultimate showdown, Extreme Kinetic Energy, Environmental Destruction Aesthetics, fast-paced editing, cinematic particle effects, epic soundtrack atmosphere. [Duration] 15 seconds [Characters] Master in White VS Master in Black [00:00-00:05] Shot 1: High-speed Collision. The white-robed and black-robed figures collide violently in the center of an ancient stone platform, moving like afterimages. The moment their weapons touch, dazzling sparks and a visible, circular high-pressure Shockwave erupt, instantly cracking the surrounding stone ground and blasting up debris. [00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Mid-air Combat & Destruction. The two figures take flight, rapidly weaving and clashing among falling giant rocks, moving too fast for their moves to be clearly seen. Each parry triggers a sound effect suggesting air distortion. They crash through a massive stone pillar, which collapses and shatters, filling the air with smoke and dust, demonstrating ultimate destructive power. [00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Ultimate Climax. Both figures land and simultaneously unleash their ultimate moves, two massive energy masses (one cyan, one red) colliding. This triggers a cataclysmic explosion of dust and energy, a mushroom cloud of smoke obscures everything, and the entire stone platform base begins to collapse and sink.
```

The camera rotates 360 degrees around him, and bamboo leaves fall continuously. The swordsman suddenly strikes, a sword energy slashes through the bamboo forest, and several bamboo stalks snap instantly. A long take, one shot, pushes in from a wide shot to a close-up of the swordsman's face, showing a cold and resolute expression. Environmental sound: wind, rustling bamboo leaves, sword clang.

### Wong Kar-wai Style Melancholy Phone Booth Scene

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, three-shot prompt for a 10-second video mimicking the style of 90s Hong Kong Art Cinema (Wong Kar-wai). It specifies visual elements (retro film grain, yellow-green tint, step-printing/slow shutter drag), a key line of dialogue, and camera techniques (peeking through glass, extreme close-up, handheld feel) to convey intense loneliness and suppressed emotion in a rainy phone booth scene.

```
[Film Style]: 90s Hong Kong Art Cinema style, retro film grain, High ISO Grain, ambiguous Yellow-Green Tint, Step-printing effect, melancholic atmosphere.

[Core Dialogue (for emotional control)]: “If memory were a can of food, I hope it would never expire.”

[Video Duration]: 10 seconds
[Storyboard]:

[00:00-00:04] Shot 1: Through the Glass.
Scene: A red public telephone booth covered in rainwater.
Character: A man (or woman) wearing a khaki trench coat, tightly gripping the receiver, not speaking, just listening.
Emotional Performance: Through the refraction of the glass, their eyes appear hollow yet deeply emotional. Rain runs down the glass, distorting their face like an oil painting.
Subtitle/Narration Feel: The scene seems frozen, with only the sound of rain.

[00:04-00:07] Shot 2: Extreme Close-up & Micro-expression.
Scene: Focuses on the character's lips and half of their face.
Action: He/She whispers softly into the receiver. The lips tremble slightly, seeming to want to say something but holding back.
Lighting: Neon light bokeh from the street flows across their face, flickering on and off.
Dialogue Emotion Mapping: Expresses extreme restraint and loneliness, like “wanting to touch but pulling the hand back.”

[00:07-00:10] Shot 3: Signature Smeary Slow Motion.
Scene: The character hangs up the phone, turns, and walks into the crowd in the rainy night.
Visual Effects: Uses a Step-printing effect (Stop-motion feel), the character's silhouette becomes blurred and has Motion Blur, as if their soul remains in place while only their body moves.
Environment: The background features flowing city car lights, forming elongated light trails.

[Technical Parameters]: Simulated Handheld Camera, shallow depth of field, color shift, intense emotion.
```

### Hollywood Sci-Fi Cyberpunk Chase Scene

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A highly detailed, three-shot prompt for a 10-second video simulating a Hollywood Sci-Fi Blockbuster with Cyberpunk Aesthetics. It specifies camera techniques (wide-angle tracking, tight action shot, epic pull-back), environment (rainy megacity, neon lights, holographic ads), and technical parameters (8k UHD, Teal & Orange grading, HDR, complex particle effects) focusing on a high-speed anti-gravity vehicle chase.

```
[Film Style]: Hollywood Sci-Fi Blockbuster, Cyberpunk Aesthetics, high-contrast neon lighting, IMAX cinematic texture, epic soundtrack feel. [Video Duration]: 10 seconds [Storyboard]: [00:00-00:04] Shot 1: Wide Angle Tracking Shot with extreme depth of field. Scene: A futuristic Megacity canyon at night, it is raining. Action: A streamlined Anti-gravity Vehicle speeds through the skyscrapers. Environmental Details (Core Test Point): Countless huge Holographic Ads are flashing, and neon lights reflect complexly on the wet glass curtain walls and the surface of the vehicle. The vehicle's tail leaves long blue Light Trails. [00:04-00:07] Shot 2: Tight Action Shot / Cockpit View. Action: The vehicle performs a sharp turn and side-slip maneuver to avoid an obstacle. Details: The camera is very close to the vehicle, showing Sparks and mist generated as the fuselage scrapes the edge of a building. Rain hits the lens densely and is blown away by the high-speed airflow. The screen is full of the sense of vibration caused by speed (Camera Shake). [00:07-00:10] Shot 3: Epic Pull-back / Crane Shot. Action: The vehicle rushes out of the narrow cluster of buildings and flies towards an open central city square. Scene: The view suddenly opens up, showing a breathtaking panoramic view of the giant city. The vehicle breaks through a layer of massive low-altitude clouds, which roll and surge due to airflow (Volumetric Clouds & Turbulence). A huge Lens Flare spans the screen. [Technical Parameters]: 8k Ultra HD, cinematic color grading (Teal & Orange), extremely high Dynamic Range (HDR), complex particle effect rendering.

### Classical Wuxia Duel in Bamboo Forest

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A prompt for a 10-second video generating a classical Eastern Wuxia scene in a bamboo forest. It specifies the aesthetic (emerald green, cinematic lighting, soft light beams), defines two characters (male in white, female in cyan), and details three shots: a wide shot establishing the scene with light movements, a slow-motion mid-shot of swords clashing, and a dynamic tracking shot emphasizing speed and flowing bamboo leaves.

```
[Visual Style] Eastern Classical Wuxia Aesthetics, cinematic visual language, bamboo forest sea landscape, emerald green main color tone, rich layering of light and shadow, soft light beam effects visible within the forest. [Character Definition] 1. Male Swordsman: Dressed in a plain white long robe, steady posture, concise and powerful movements. 2. Female Swordsman: Dressed in a cyan-phoenix colored light gauze dress, light and smooth movements, agile posture. [Video Duration] 10 seconds [Storyboard] [00:00-00:03] Shot 1: Wide Shot Composition. Scene: The tops of tall, dense bamboo forests, with clouds and mist slowly flowing through the grove. Action: The male and female swordsmen stand separately among the high bamboo shadows, their bodies light and stable, as if maintaining balance by utilizing airflow and the bamboo's momentum. Detail: Bamboo branches naturally bend and spring back in the breeze, and the figures' postures subtly fluctuate with the bamboo shadows, presenting an impressionistic effect of Qinggong (lightness skill). The overall scene is quiet yet tense. [00:00-00:06] Shot 2: Medium Shot, Slow Motion. Action: The two figures leap almost simultaneously, crossing paths in the air. Interaction: Two sword shadows briefly intersect in the air, forming a bright light streak. Surrounding bamboo leaves are driven by the airflow, slowly spinning and scattering. Visual Focus: Leaves flutter in the air, creating distinct foreground and background layers. The movement is smooth, without exaggerated impact. [00:06-00:10] Shot 3: Dynamic Tracking Shot. Action: The female swordsman glides forward, her sleeve brushing past bamboo branches to change direction; the male swordsman continuously follows, using the bamboo for leverage, with light, rhythmic steps. Environmental Feedback: The camera smoothly tracks the movement. The bamboo forest forms a natural speed blur effect at the edges of the frame. Visual Effect: Each movement kicks up a large amount of scattered bamboo leaves, flowing like leaf rain in the frame, enhancing the sense of spatial depth and dynamic beauty. [Technical Requirements] Cinematic lighting, saturated but clearly layered colors, natural depth of field, stable and clean visuals, presenting the overall impressionistic beauty and spatial tension of Eastern Wuxia.

### Tang Bohu E-Sports Showdown (Spring Festival Gala Style)

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A highly detailed, 10-second prompt for a video blending Ming Dynasty scholar aesthetics with modern e-sports, set on a grand Spring Festival Gala stage. The script specifies character attire (Ming Dynasty robes + LED gaming headset), environment (red/gold festive lighting, RGB keyboard, ink-wash MOBA game), dynamic camera movements (push-in, ECU), and dialogue, creating an absurd, high-contrast scene.

```
10-second Chinese Spring Festival Gala style stage performance: “Tang Bohu E-Sports Showdown”

0–2 seconds:
Medium-long shot establishes the environment.
The stage is designed as the magnificent Spring Festival Gala main stage, enveloped in rich red and gold festive lighting, with digital lantern projections in the background.
In the center of the stage, Tang Bohu sits on a professional e-sports chair.
Key Historical Accuracy Requirement: He is dressed in authentic Ming Dynasty scholar attire—wearing a black square scarf (fangjin) on his head and a flowing blue round-collar robe (lan shan).
Strong Contrast: On top of the traditional scarf, he wears a heavy, modern professional e-sports headset, with LED light effects flashing on the edges.

2–4 seconds:
Cut to a close-up of the hands and desk.
Fingers rapidly tap a glowing RGB mechanical keyboard, emerging from wide Ming Dynasty scholar sleeves.
Three curved e-sports monitors are placed in front of him.
Screen Content: Displays a MOBA-type game (similar to 'League of Legends'), but the overall art style has been completely reconstructed into traditional Chinese ink wash painting style.

4–6 seconds:
Dynamic Camera Movement: The camera rapidly pushes forward, seemingly passing directly through the ink wash battlefield on the central monitor, finally landing on an **Extreme Close-Up (ECU)** of Tang Bohu's eyes.
The cold blue light emitted by the monitor reflects strongly in his pupils, contrasting sharply with the warm stage lighting on his face.
He looks focused and passionate, his mouth movements synchronized as he recites:
“Others laugh at my madness, but I laugh at their inability to see!”

6–8 seconds:
The camera quickly pulls back to a tight half-body close-up, showing his highly engaged expression.
He shouts excitedly into the headset microphone, neck veins bulging:
“Mid lane push, Qiuxiang is my support, who dares to gank her?”

8–10 seconds:
Full stage shot, moment of victory.
Tang Bohu slams the keyboard and raises his hands in celebration.
Golden streamers explode around his e-sports equipment.
The Spring Festival Gala LED screen behind him flashes huge ink wash calligraphy characters—
“Victory.”

Style and Atmosphere:

**Visual Core:** Strong clash of eras—the warmth, solemnity, and high-spec stage feel of the CCTV Spring Festival Gala × the cold, high-intensity blue light effects of e-sports equipment.

**Costume Setting:** Serious, historically accurate Ming Dynasty scholar attire, forming an absurd contrast with modern e-sports gear.

**Camera Language:** Highly dynamic, emphasizing “screen-penetrating push-in” shots and extreme close-ups.

**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9

### Skiing Video Generation Prompt with Detailed Scene Breakdown

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A highly detailed, scene-by-scene prompt for generating a 15-second skiing video using Seedance 2.0. The prompt specifies the overall style (bright, energetic, cinematic), camera movements, shot types (close-up, medium shot, overhead), actions, and emotional tone across five distinct time segments, focusing on speed, rhythm, and dynamic movement. This prompt requires a reference image of the main character.

```
Please generate a skiing video based on the provided reference image. The overall style should be bright, refreshing, full of athletic vitality, with smooth visuals and a cinematic camera language. The timeline and shot design are as follows: 
 0–3 seconds: The person in the image smiles and looks at the camera in the snow. The camera shakes slightly, and snowflakes fall. The background wind noise gradually increases, and the screen shows a sense of rapid wind and snow flow. 
3–5 seconds: Quick cut to an extreme close-up of the person's feet, the moment the ski bindings lock, and the snow is crushed. At the same time, the camera lifts, connecting to an overhead view of a steep slope, with a clear gradient, suggesting an imminent burst of speed.
 5–8 seconds: The person in the image skis down from a high point at high speed. Shot one is a medium shot follow-up from the side-front, with the body leaning forward and sharp movements; Shot two cuts to an overhead view, the steep slope extends downward, and the snow track lines stretch rapidly, creating an intense sense of speed. 
8–11 seconds: Continuous quick cuts. Low-angle ground-level shot, the skis skim the snow surface, and snow powder is thrown up at high speed; A long shot shows the person making a beautiful turn on the steep slope, forming a smooth curve with the snow line. 
11–13 seconds: The camera returns to a front-facing follow-up shot. The person speeds towards the camera, making a sharp turn at close range, causing a large amount of snow to be kicked up.
13–15 seconds: A large amount of snow powder splashes directly onto the lens. The screen is covered by white snow mist, and the lens briefly loses focus before freezing, leaving a strong dynamic aftertaste. The overall emphasis is on speed, cutting rhythm, realistic movement, and youthful vitality. The visuals are bright, not heavy, highlighting the excitement and freedom of skiing.

### Dark Fantasy/Horror Narrative Prompt

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A long, highly descriptive narrative prompt focusing on a dark, cold, and stormy scene in a forest, emphasizing sensory details like the wind, lashing snow, trembling torchlight, and the 'wrong-cold' feeling of mail armor. This prompt aims for a cinematic, atmospheric video generation.

```
The wind threads through the black pines like a dull blade scraping bone. Snow doesn’t fall—it lashes sideways, stinging into the gaps of a collar, melting into a sharp, immediate pain. The torchlight trembles in the white storm, revealing a trunk, a branch, a sliver of ground—then surrendering it back to the deeper dark. They move slowly. Boots sink with a muffled crunch, and every step feels like an argument with the forest: please don’t notice us. Someone coughs once and regrets it instantly—the sound rebounds, thin and humiliating, as if the trees are laughing at his fear. The mail should be warm by now, tempered by body heat, but it isn’t. It’s wrong-cold, as though an unseen chill is crawling over the metal from the outside in.
```

> A detailed, multi-scene video generation prompt for ByteDance's Seedance 2.0, creating a 10-second cross-genre video featuring characters from the Qing Dynasty drama 'Empresses in the Palace' performing a modern talk show in the style of the Chinese New Year Gala (Chunwan). The prompt specifies camera shots, character actions, dialogue, costume details, and stylistic contrasts.

```
10-second stage performance in the style of the Chinese New Year Gala (Chunwan): “Zhen Huan & Consort Hua Talk Show”

0–2 seconds:
Medium Two-shot.
The stage setting is a “living room skit,” but the periphery is surrounded by a grand, red and gold LED main screen typical of Chunwan.
Zhen Huan (left) and Consort Hua (right) sit side-by-side on a modern talk show sofa.
Key historical accuracy requirement: Both are wearing ornate, distinctly differentiated Manchu Qing Dynasty court flag dresses (Qizhuang), with stand collars, complex and exquisite embroidery; their hairstyles are accurately restored “Da La Chi” or “Dian Zi Tou,” adorned with tassel decorations.
Consort Hua looks casual, holding a pickled cucumber (sour cucumber) and gnawing on it, wearing long golden nail guards (finger covers) on her fingers.
2–4 seconds:
Camera switches to an Over-the-Shoulder (OTS) shot, focusing on Consort Hua.
Consort Hua rolls her eyes exaggeratedly (the classic “eye roll” expression).
While holding the pickled cucumber, she points and gestures with her fingers wearing long nail guards, speaking in an arrogant tone (lip sync):
“This year, my KPI is once again defeating these little demons. What does that old man, the Emperor, know about aesthetics?”
4–6 seconds:
Quick switch to Zhen Huan’s Over-the-Shoulder (OTS) shot.
Contrast detail: Zhen Huan wears a modern white Bluetooth earphone on one ear (a strong contrast with the ancient jewelry), and is scrolling on a thin tablet computer in her hand.
She responds calmly and professionally (lip sync):
“Sister, don’t be angry, this is called workplace involution. I’m thinking of quitting and selling ‘Shu Hen Jiao’ (Scar-Removing Balm).”
6–8 seconds:
Close-up shot focuses on the coffee table between the two.
A modern plastic bubble tea cup labeled “Yi Zhang Hong” (A Rod of Red) is placed next to a traditional porcelain vase.
The camera quickly whips back to the two of them.
8–10 seconds:
Full stage view.
Audience laughter effect (presented via lighting changes / applause lights).
Consort Hua strikes her final pose: legs crossed, chin raised, rolling her eyes again.
Zhen Huan smiles professionally at the camera, like a news anchor.
Golden streamers fall from the air.
The festive red atmosphere is pushed to its climax.
Style and Atmosphere:

**Visuals:** High-saturation Chunwan red and gilded tones
**Costumes:** Museum-grade Qing Dynasty court attire (silk, fine embroidery, heavy headwear)
**Core Contrast:** The solemnity of Qing court etiquette × the relaxed, complaining posture of modern office workers / talk show guests
**Cinematography:** Sharp rhythm, clear comedic points, sitcom-style editing
**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9
```

### Seedance 2.0 Historical Time-Travel Drama Trailer Prompt

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-scene prompt for Seedance 2.0 to generate a 15-second trailer for a historical time-travel drama titled 'Drunken Dream of Splendor,' using a reference image for the male protagonist's appearance.

```
Generate a trailer for a historical time-travel drama using the character image from the reference photo. 0-3 seconds scene: The male protagonist, whose appearance is based on Reference Image 1, holds up a basketball and looks up at the camera. He says, "I just wanted a drink, am I about to time travel...?" 4-8 seconds scene: The camera suddenly shakes violently, the playground scene begins to vibrate intensely, instantly switching to a rainy night at an ancient mansion. A beautiful female protagonist in ancient costume, with cold eyes piercing through the rain, looks towards the camera. Thunder rumbles, and clothes flutter in the wind. The female protagonist says, "Who dares trespass into my Yongning Marquis Manor?" 9-13 seconds scene: The camera cuts to a man in Ming dynasty official attire sitting in a yamen (court), his eyes sharp as knives, angrily saying, "Guards! Seize this 'demon' immediately!" Flashbacks: The male protagonist wears ill-fitting coarse cloth; he flees desperately surrounded by constables; his figure crosses paths with the female protagonist in a rainy alley; the male protagonist walks in the imperial palace wearing official robes. 14-15 seconds scene: Black screen, displaying the title "Drunken Dream of Splendor," accompanied by heavy drum beats.
