### Speeder Chase Across a Cliff City (Single Continuous Shot)

![Featured](https://img.shields.io/badge/⭐-Featured-gold)
![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> An extremely detailed, continuous-shot prompt describing a high-speed speeedr chase through a monumental cliffside city, focusing on dynamic camera movement, heat haze, debris, and culminating in a reveal of a waterfall-fed valley.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
Speeder chase across a cliff city (single continuous shot) From a monumental cliffside city carved into stone, the camera dives toward a tiny streak of light ripping along a narrow ledge-road. Lock-on: a speeder hugging the wall at insane speed. The camera slingshots ahead, whips back, then drops tight to the rear thrusters: heat haze, grit snapping off the ledge, warning lights flashing. A collapsing balcony rains debris; the rider snaps a last-inch swerve under a falling arch, then threads through hanging laundry lines and open windows in one fluid line. The camera darts through the same openings, staying glued to the motion. One final bend and sudden calm: the camera blasts outward into a reveal of the city opening onto a boundless waterfall-fed valley, mist turning into rainbow.

### Surreal Ronin Action Scene

![Featured](https://img.shields.io/badge/⭐-Featured-gold)
![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, cinematic prompt for Seedance 2.0 describing a complex action sequence: a masked ronin fighting a colossal winged beast on floating rock islands during a thunderstorm, with specific camera movements and a dramatic finale.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
A surreal battlefield in the sky: floating rock islands drifting through a thunderstorm, clouds swirling below like an ocean. The masked ronin dashes across the drifting platforms, pursued by a colossal winged beast whose chest is a swirling vortex of storm clouds and lightning. The camera hurtles from island to island, struggling to keep up as rocks tilt, spin, and crumble away beneath them. Every wingbeat sends shockwaves through the air, shaking the frame and blowing debris and rain straight into the viewer’s face. Rapid handheld cuts capture the ronin leaping impossible gaps, sword carving arcs of light that briefly cut through the darkness. The finale shows the camera diving behind him as he jumps off the last crumbling rock, riding a bolt of lightning directly into the monster’s chest vortex with a final, all-or-nothing slash that explodes the storm from within and clears the sky in a blinding flash.

### Live-Action Anime Adaptation: Water vs. Thunder Breathing Duel

![Featured](https://img.shields.io/badge/⭐-Featured-gold)
![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A highly detailed, 15-second prompt for generating a live-action adaptation of an anime-style duel, featuring 'Water Breathing' (blue water dragon) versus 'Thunder Breathing' (golden lightning). The prompt specifies the style (Hollywood live-action, dark samurai, 4K, fast cuts), scene setting (misty forest under moonlight), and three distinct, action-packed shots detailing character actions, special effects, and the final collision of powers.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
Live-Action Anime Adaptation · Breathing Technique Decisive Battle (15 seconds · Super Burning Special Effects Version)
【Core Focus】: Water Breathing (Blue Water Dragon) VS Thunder Breathing (Golden Lightning), live-action extreme speed duel.

【Style】: Hollywood live-action anime adaptation film quality, dark samurai style, 4K ultra-clear, extreme fast cuts, explosive particle light effects, no gore.
【Duration】: 15 seconds
【Scene】: Misty forest under the moonlight, muddy ground, falling leaves.

[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Water Melody Prelude · Starting Stance (Sense of charging)
Visuals: A young samurai wearing a green and black checkered haori (jacket), lowering his center of gravity under the moonlight, gripping his sword with both hands.
Action: He takes a deep breath, and the surrounding air instantly solidifies. As he draws his sword, a giant blue water dragon, condensed from high-pressure water flow, appears out of thin air, rotating rapidly around his body and blade, emitting the roar of flowing water.
Special Effects Details: The water flow has a realistic sense of splashing, illuminating the dark forest.

[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Thunder Flash · Charge (Sense of extreme speed)
Visuals: The opponent, a blonde swordsman wearing a yellow triangular patterned haori, is crouched extremely low, adopting the posture of Iaijutsu (sword drawing technique).
Action: The ground suddenly explodes, and he instantly transforms into a dazzling golden lightning afterimage, refracting and charging through the forest in a "Z" shape at a speed undetectable by the naked eye.
Special Effects Details: Golden electric arcs and scorched fallen leaves remain in the places he passes.

[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Water and Thunder Collision · Final Sound (Ultimate move clash)
Visuals: Extreme speed collision. The young samurai swings the giant blue water dragon down to meet the attack, and the blonde swordsman, transformed into lightning, crashes into him head-on.
Action: The two swords violently collide in the center of the frame.
Special Effects Spectacle: The blue water dragon and the golden lightning instantly explode, forming a massive water-thunder energy storm that spreads outwards. The surrounding large trees are snapped in half by the energy wave, and mud and light obscure the camera. The scene ends in an extremely dazzling blue, yellow, and white light.

#### 📝 Prompt

A beautiful young adult redhead stands at the center of a surreal Valentine’s garden, framed in an intimate portrait composition. Her copper waves fall softly over her shoulders, glowing under warm rose and blush lighting. She looks down tenderly at three cats gathered close to her, a snow-white cat with pearly reflections, a warm ginger cat with golden highlights, and a sleek black cat edged in soft magenta light.
The entire environment is fully immersive and floral: translucent heart-shaped blossoms in saturated pink, coral, and ruby tones surround her on every side. Foreground flowers are slightly blurred for depth, while the background dissolves into glowing bokeh hearts and floating golden particles. Thin ribbons of soft luminous light arc gently between her and the cats, symbolizing affection.

### Seedance 2.0 Prompt: Basketball Block Scene

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed Seedance 2.0 prompt for a 15-second cinematic, realistic video depicting a street basketball scene where a smaller girl successfully blocks a shot from a large, confident male player. The prompt specifies lighting, setting, character descriptions, camera movements (handheld follow shot), slow-motion effects, sound design, and the emotional arc of the characters.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
15 seconds, cinematic realistic style, golden hour warm light, American street basketball atmosphere. 0-3 seconds: Los Angeles outdoor street basketball court, sunlight slanting, a tall and muscular American Black male player wearing a sleeveless training vest and sports shorts, warming up with crossover dribbles, defined muscle lines, confident and contemptuous expression. Standing opposite is a petite American blonde young girl with a high ponytail, wearing a loose basketball short sleeve and sports shorts, with a calm and composed expression. The male player smiles, taps the ball, and signals her to attack. Mid-shot, eye-level view of the two confronting each other; 4-8 seconds: The male player starts to attack, continuously showing off with crossover and behind-the-back dribbles. Sneaker friction raises dust from the ground. He suddenly accelerates and breaks through to the right, preparing for a layup. A handheld follow-shot closely tracks his foot movement. The girl moves quickly and flexibly, shifting sideways to hold her position, her expression focused, eyes locked on the basketball; 9-12 seconds: Slow-motion ramp-up, the male player jumps up preparing for a right-hand layup. Just as the ball is raised above his head, the girl jumps simultaneously, her body stretched and airborne. Her right hand precisely slaps the basketball hard at the highest point, sending the ball spinning out of the frame. The male player's expression in the air instantly changes from confident to shocked, eyes wide and mouth open. The camera angle looks up, capturing the moment both are airborne; 13-15 seconds: Returns to normal speed, the male player lands, stumbles back two steps, hands on knees, bending over and panting, face full of disbelief. The girl lands easily, flicks her ponytail, expressionless, picks up the basketball, dribbles it twice with one hand, slightly tilts her head, glances at him with a hint of disdainful smile, turns and walks away, her back view decisive and neat. Sound effects: Street environment sounds throughout, clear and realistic sounds of dribbling and squeaking sneakers. A dull, powerful slap sound at the moment of the block, accompanied by "Ohhh" exclamations from surrounding onlookers. Ends with a low, rhythmic hip-hop beat. No text, subtitles, or watermarks allowed.

### Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Temple Awakening Cinematic Prompt

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-scene prompt for Seedance 2.0 to generate a 15-second cinematic trailer in the style of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, focusing on an ancient ruin exploration. The prompt specifies a blend of cel-shading and watercolor, cold blue-green tones, camera movements, and sound design for the awakening of a hero in a temple.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
16:9 widescreen, fantasy adventure game screen style merging cel-shading rendering and watercolor blending, predominantly blue-green cool tones with warm light accents, 15 seconds of ancient ruin exploration.
0-4 seconds: A pair of eyes slowly opens in the darkness, the sapphire blue pupils reflect blue light. The camera pulls back, a blonde boy slowly sits up on a glowing stone altar. The surroundings are a dim ancient stone chamber, the walls covered with mysterious patterns emitting a faint blue glow. The patterns extend outward like circuits, pulsating and flickering. Water drops fall from the stone wall, echoing distantly; 5-9 seconds: The boy steps barefoot onto the cold stone floor and walks towards a huge stone door at the end of the chamber. He reaches out to touch the circular mechanism rune on the door. Blue light spreads outward from the point of contact like water ripples, and the ancient patterns on the entire stone door are activated and light up sequentially. The stone door opens with a crash, and dazzling white natural light pours in from outside, submerging the entire frame. The camera follows the boy as he steps into the light; 10-15 seconds: The light dissipates, and a magnificent extreme long shot unfolds. The boy stands on the edge of a towering cliff, facing a boundless panoramic view of a fantasy world—emerald green forests, azure lakes, huge islands floating in the distance, snow-capped mountains surrounded by clouds, and a massive castle ruin emitting golden light on the horizon. The wind blows the boy's hair and clothes. The camera slowly pulls back and rises from behind the boy, taking in the entire magnificent world. Sound effects: Water drop echoes and low temple resonance at the opening, layered electronic sound effects when the stone door mechanism activates, heavy rumbling sound when the stone door opens. When the world unfolds, the orchestral music bursts from silence into a grand and magnificent main theme. Wind sounds run through the ending. Prohibited: Any text, subtitles, LOGO, or watermark.

### Cinematic Fight Scene Prompt for Seedance 2.0

> A detailed, cinematic prompt designed to generate a high-action fight scene between two men, featuring ultra-high-speed punches with afterimages, dramatic camera movements, slow-motion effects, and a powerful finishing blow, originally written by an LLM (Chappy).

#### 📝 Prompt

```
The two men in the image exchange ultra-high-speed punches with afterimages, like a JoJo's Ora Ora Rush. Finally, the masked man's punch catches the suited man's cheek, sending the suited man flying backward like a rocket, where he falls to the ground and loses consciousness. During the punch exchange, the camera rapidly rotates around the two men to capture the intense fight. The camera focuses on the masked man's final punch catching the suited man's cheek in slow motion, returning to normal speed the moment the suited man is blown backward.

The wilderness is dotted with stylized low-poly trees and wildflowers, an ancient stone tower wrapped in vines is visible in the distance standing on a cliff edge, light blue particle motes float in the air, the camera slowly pushes down from above through the clouds, morning birdsong and wind sounds; 5-9 seconds: Follow shot, a blonde boy wearing a blue adventurer's tunic stands on the cliff edge overlooking the land, his cloak fluttering in the wind. He jumps off the cliff and deploys a cloth paraglider, the camera follows the boy gliding in the airflow from the side. Below him is the vast cel-shaded landscape—winding rivers, dense forests, ruined castles, a distant volcano emitting orange-red smoke, sunlight casts transparent shadows on the paraglider fabric; 10-15 seconds: The boy retracts the paraglider and lands on a patch of grass, casually pulling out a rusty sword from the ground. A round blue jelly-like small monster suddenly jumps out from the grass in front. The boy assumes a fighting stance, the small monster angrily bounces towards him. The boy nimbly dodges and lightly strikes the small monster with his sword, causing it to fly away and dissipate into purple smoke. The boy sheathes his sword and looks towards the silhouette of the huge castle ruins in the distance, wind blowing through the grass waves like a green ocean. Sound effects: Morning wind and birdsong open the scene, whooshing airflow and fabric vibration sounds during gliding, rustling sounds of grass upon landing, metallic friction sound when drawing the sword, crisp strike sound during combat, overlaid with cheerful orchestral and piano melodies throughout.

Chang'e's face is delicate like a fine-line court lady, the hairpins on her bun gently sway, scattered petals transform into light ink dots slowly drifting away; 10-15 seconds: Extreme long shot pull-out, Chang'e flies towards the bright moon with fluttering robes, trailing an elegant, ink-splash-like long streak behind her. The entire scene slowly closes like an ink wash scroll. Moonlight spills across the world like light ink spreading amidst the gathering and dispersing clouds, finally Chang'e becomes a slender silhouette in the moon, the lingering sound of the guzheng echoes. Sound effects: Guzheng solo as the main melody, accompanied by a distant bamboo flute, gentle wind sounds interspersed, the subtle rustle of silk fabric fluttering. Prohibited: Any text, subtitles, LOGO, or watermark, prohibited from containing modern elements.

Version 2: Fine-line Heavy Color

Seedance 2.0 Prompt
Fusion style of Chinese fine-line heavy color and freehand ink wash, silk painting texture, 15 seconds of Chang'e flying to the moon. 0-4 seconds: Close-up of Chang'e's face, fine-line drawn willow-leaf eyebrows and phoenix eyes, skin like congealed fat, a cinnabar flower mark on her forehead, hair strands clearly defined like fine threads. The camera slowly pulls back, Chang'e stands on a stone platform in the clouds, wearing a moon-white cross-collar ruqun covered with a light cyan gauze coat, a reddish-brown silk sash tied around her waist, the skirt embroidered with light gold osmanthus patterns, holding a jade rabbit, looking slightly up at the moon, low notes of the guzheng plucked; 5-10 seconds: Follow shot, Chang'e lightly lifts her skirt and leaps up, stepping on auspicious clouds and soaring straight up. Her wide sleeves flutter in the wind like the wings of two white cranes spreading. The gauze ribbons behind her transform into freehand ink splash strokes extending several feet. The clouds beneath her feet spread out in layers using the Chinese painting rendering technique, dark ink nearby, light ink far away. Osmanthus petals scatter like gold dust, the guzheng melody quickens, and the flute joins the ensemble; 11-15 seconds: Extreme long shot overhead composition, below is the ink wash ground with the aesthetic of negative space. Chang'e is in the center of the frame ascending towards the giant golden full moon, her robes and ribbons scatter to form a beautiful S-curve. The faint outline of the osmanthus tree palace is vaguely visible in the moon. The entire picture presents the Eastern aesthetic composition of 'round heaven and square earth,' and the light and shadow are soft like silk rendering. Sound effects: Guzheng and bamboo flute play the main melody together, crisp wind chimes embellish, the rustle of silk fabric in the wind, the final guzheng harmonic note fades distantly. Prohibited: Any text, subtitles, LOGO, or watermark, prohibited from containing modern elements.

Version 3: Freehand Ink Splash

Seedance 2.0 Prompt
Traditional Chinese freehand ink splash style, predominantly black and white ink with only the moon dotted in gold, minimalist negative space aesthetic, 15 seconds of Chang'e flying to the moon. 0-5 seconds: Pure white background like rice paper, a drop of thick ink falls from the top of the frame. The ink drop splashes upon contact, transforming into mountain shapes. The ink naturally spreads to form near and distant peaks, the camera slowly pushes in, the varying shades of ink automatically blend to create pine trees and clouds. A golden full moon gradually appears in the large area of negative space, the single string of the guzheng is plucked, echoing ethereal; 6-10 seconds: A streak of 'flying white' brushwork rapidly sweeps across the right side of the frame, transforming into the ascending figure of Chang'e. Freehand brushwork outlines the fluttering dress and ribbons with just a few strokes. Chang'e's figure is faintly visible like a phantom in the ink. Every flutter of her robes splashes new ink drops that become auspicious clouds and flying flowers beside her. The entire ascent process is like a calligraphy master wielding a brush, smooth and continuous. 11-15 seconds: Chang'e's ink figure merges into the golden full moon. The ink around the moon spreads into layers of halos. The picture gradually settles into a complete ink wash composition—a large area of negative space between heaven and earth, a golden moon, a slender silhouette within the moon, and vast ink splash mountains below, conveying profound artistic conception. The lingering sound of the guzheng echoes in the negative space. Sound effects: Guzheng solo is clear and ethereal, accompanied by a crisp water drop sound when ink hits the paper, the wind sound is extremely faint and only serves as atmosphere setting, the entire process is quiet and distant. Prohibited: Any text, subtitles, LOGO, or watermark, prohibited from containing modern elements, prohibited from containing color (only the moon is golden).

### Cinematic Train Sequence Prompt for Seedance 2.0

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A highly detailed, multi-shot prompt for Seedance 2.0 focusing on complex camera work and scene transitions involving a high-speed train (Shinkansen) passing through a rural landscape. The prompt uses advanced cinematic techniques like 'Ascending Reveal,' 'Vertigo Chase,' 'Spatial Transition,' and 'Elegant Orbit' to create a six-part sequence.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
Opening - Silent Dawn (Using Combined Camera Movement 3: Ascending Reveal)

The scene begins with a close-up of a spider web covered in morning dew, the dewdrops reflecting a blurred pastoral reflection. The camera slowly pulls back and rises like a breath, gradually revealing the boundless rice fields below, tightly locked in thin fog. On the distant horizon, a thin silver line silently cuts through the grayish-blue sky—that is the Shinkansen. (Ascending shot + Pull-out shot, Emotion: Tranquility, poetry, foreshadowing)

Acceleration - Metal Behemoth (Using Combined Camera Movement 4: Vertigo Chase + partial elements of Combined Movement 1)

Suddenly, the camera seems to be captured by magnetic force, sprinting towards the silver track ahead with impossible acceleration. Intense handheld shaking simulates the violent air current, and the rice fields instantly turn into a green torrent. The camera rapidly pans horizontally, keeping pace with the rapidly approaching train head. At the moment speed synchronizes, all sound in the world is stripped away, leaving only a visually intense Dutch angle tilt, emphasizing this extraordinary kinetic energy. (Intense handheld shake + Rapid horizontal pan + Dutch angle, Emotion: Burst, shock, imbalance)

Penetration - Boundary Shift (Using Combined Camera Movement 9: Spatial Transition)

Just before impact with the train head, the camera focuses on the side window of the driver's cab. A cold, honeycomb-like glass texture fills the screen. Match cut point: A slow-motion phantom of a bird hitting the glass, and at the moment of contact, the camera seamlessly penetrates. The cold, high-speed world outside suddenly switches to the warm, silent, low-noise passenger cabin inside. The light transitions from cold blue to warm yellow. (Match cut + Light/texture transformation, Emotion: Magical, turning point, entering an alternate space)

Contemplation - The Still Heart (Using Combined Camera Movement 5: Elegant Orbit and elements of Combined Movement 2)

After the camera enters, all movement returns to absolute stillness. With a Steadicam-like floating sensation, it gently orbits the woman by the window along the aisle. As it passes her profile, an extremely slow push-in focuses on her glasses lens—the blurred, flowing mountains and villages outside the window are reflected in the lens like an abstract painting. Steam from the cup rises slowly, defying physics. (Steadicam smooth orbit + Extremely slow push-in + Macro close-up, Emotion: Serenity, introspection, time suspended)

Extraction - External Spiral (Reusing Combined Camera Movement 4: Enhanced Vertigo Chase)

The camera exits through the window on the other side, instantly returning to the eye of the speed storm. It begins a high-speed spiral orbit centered on the train, the streamlined body carving dazzling metallic arcs in the sunlight. The intense orbiting motion combined with handheld tremor is dizzying, showcasing the pure aesthetic of machinery and speed. (High-speed spiral orbit + Handheld shake, Emotion: Abstraction, vertigo, mechanical aesthetic)

Curtain Call - Bridge to Heaven and Earth (Using Combined Camera Movement 8: Grand Entrance Variation)

At the highest point of the spiral, the camera sharply pulls back and up. The train is crossing a giant iron bridge spanning a lush green canyon, its form appearing precise and elegant. The camera continues to rise, accompanied by a horizontal pan, revealing the full view of the canyon and distant mountains. It finally freezes in a vast aerial long shot: the silver train, like a fine needle, quietly disappears into the shadow tunnel of the great mountain. All sounds cease, only the last wisp of a distant whistle echoes gently among the mountains until it fades away. (Large-scale pull-out shot + Ascending/Descending + Horizontal pan, Emotion: Grandeur, detachment, returning to eternity)

### Wuxia Swordsman Duel Prompt

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, cinematic prompt for Seedance 2.0 describing a Wuxia-style audiovisual blockbuster featuring a duel between two swordsmen in a bamboo forest, focusing on camera movement, atmosphere, and ultra-slow motion effects during the clash.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
A Wuxia-style audiovisual blockbuster. A white-clad swordsman and a straw-caped blademaster face off in a bamboo forest. The camera slowly pushes in between them, shifting focus between raindrops and sword hilts. The atmosphere is extremely oppressive; only the sound of rain can be heard. Suddenly, a crack of thunder flashes, and both charge simultaneously. A fast-panning profile shot captures their mud-splattering footsteps. The precise moment their weapons clash, the footage switches to ultra-slow motion, clearly displaying the ring-shaped shockwaves of rainwater blasted away by the blades, along with bamboo leaves sliced by sword aura. Normal speed resumes as they land back-to-back. The straw-caped blademaster's bamboo hat splits open, and the scene cuts abruptly.

Seedance 2.0 Prompt

15-second modern short drama, luxury CEO office scene, cool-toned high-end feel. 0-3 sec: Mid-shot, a young man in a bespoke suit sits in a leather boss chair, his face cold and eyes indifferent. Standing before him is a beautiful girl in a white dress, her eyes red, tears welling up. The man says, "I gave you a chance," in a low, cold voice; 4-8 sec: The girl's voice trembles, "What chance did you give me? You never trusted me from the start!" She turns to leave, the man suddenly stands up and grabs her wrist. The camera follows the struggle, the girl is forced to turn back, they are extremely close, breathing audible. A trace of reluctance flashes in the girl's eyes but is quickly replaced by stubbornness; 9-12 sec: The man stares into the girl's eyes, his voice low, "Do you still want to leave now?" The girl bites her lip, "Leave... where else can I go?" She fiercely shakes off his hand and runs away. The man reaches out to grab but only catches air, his hand frozen mid-air; 13-15 sec: The camera follows the girl rushing out of the office. She wipes away tears in front of the elevator, but the tears keep flowing. The moment the elevator door slowly closes, she squats down and cries into her arms. The scene finally freezes on a close-up of the elevator number jumping down from 15, accompanied by a low, sad piano BGM.

A beautiful girl with a high ponytail slowly walks towards him, the camera slightly shakes with every step the girl takes to create tension; 4-8 sec: The girl approaches the boy. The boy takes a deep breath, raises his hand several times to hand over the letter but pulls it back. The girl stops in front of the boy, tilts her head and smiles, "Are you looking for me?" The boy panics, "I... I..." Before he finishes, the class bell suddenly rings, startling both of them. The corridor light flickers; 9-12 sec: The girl glances at the time, "Class is starting soon, let's talk next time," and turns to leave. The boy gathers his courage, "Wait!" He grabs her wrist, both freeze simultaneously. Only the sound of rain and their breathing remains in the corridor. The boy looks down, his cheeks flushed red, "This letter... is for you." The girl is stunned, looking down at the letter; 13-15 sec: The camera slowly pushes in for a close-up of the girl's face. A sweet smile slowly spreads across her lips, stars twinkling in her eyes. The scene finally freezes the moment she takes the letter—a ray of sunlight suddenly shines through the rainy window onto both of them, concluding with a gentle piano melody and the fading sound of rain.

The best friend's face turns ugly. The girl looks at the boyfriend, then the best friend, and finally her gaze lands on their hands—the best friend is wearing the same bracelet that the boyfriend claimed he "lost" a few days ago; 9-12 sec: The girl says nothing, just quietly picks up the wine glass and drinks it in one go. Then she stands up and walks to the best friend. Everyone holds their breath. The girl smiles and slowly pours the bottle of wine onto the best friend's limited edition handbag. The best friend widens her eyes, trying to scream, but the girl presses her shoulder; 13-15 sec: The girl leans close to the best friend's ear and whispers softly, "Next time you steal someone's man, remember to hide what shouldn't be exposed first." The best friend's face turns pale. The girl turns and walks away elegantly. The camera pulls back to show the best friend standing stiffly in place, the boyfriend full of regret, concluding with a low BGM and surrounding whispers.

### The Leviathan's Throat: Underwater Megastructure Descent

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> An extremely detailed, cinematic prompt for Seedance 2.0 describing a diver's terrifying descent through a flooded subterranean megastructure, pursued by a colossal, eyeless leviathan, culminating in the diver firing a harpoon and bursting through the surface into a vast underground ocean.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
A flooded subterranean megastructure, ancient stone corridors  half-submerged in black water, bioluminescent algae pulsing  along the walls like a heartbeat. A masked diver in scarred  tactical gear, lit by a flickering wrist-mounted flare, is  pulled downward through collapsing flooded chambers by the  current of a colossal eyeless leviathan moving beneath the  floor grates. The camera plunges after the diver as water  rushes through shattering stone archways, air bubbles and  debris spiraling past the lens. The diver grabs a broken  pillar to stop herself, the current ripping at her body, then  releases and freefalls through a vertical shaft, twisting to  dodge the leviathan's translucent tendrils whipping upward  through the darkness. Quick shaky frames catch her igniting  a harpoon gun mid-fall, the flare illuminating the creature's  massive jaw opening below. In the final movement, the camera  spirals downward around her as she fires the harpoon into the  creature's mouth, the bioluminescence erupts blinding white,  and the camera bursts through the surface of a vast  underground ocean, the diver silhouetted against the glow of  a thousand pulsing organisms on a cathedral-sized cavern  ceiling. 15 seconds..

> Three detailed, 10-second music video prompts for Seedance 2.0, covering K-pop, Guofeng (Chinese traditional style), and Future Bass/Cyberpunk genres, all focused on precise beat-matching and cinematic details.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
Version 1: K-pop Girl Group · Quick Cut Beat Sync (High Energy Stage)

  Seedance 2.0 Prompt

  10-second K-pop girl group MV beat-sync shots, 2.35:1 widescreen, 24fps, 8 quick cuts. 0-1 sec: Low-angle shot looking up, four girl group members standing in a triangular formation on the stage floor, lights flashing with the beat, the stage 'sounds like you can feel the vibration,' all members inhale simultaneously in preparation; 2-3 sec: Close-up of the center vocalist, breathing at the corner of the mouth and eye contact, slight hair movement, background light shifts from cool blue to pink-purple; 4-5 sec: Mid-shot of group choreography, explosive movements, footsteps start coming in, all members uniformly flip their hair and turn, movements are smooth and flowing; 6-7 sec: Close-up of hands, gestures drive the sound of fabric and light clinking of accessories, rings sparkle under the lights; 8-9 sec: Side view of two people, more complex movements, denser footwork, camera cuts with the action, the hand coordination of the two is precisely beat-synced; 10 sec: Near-shot freeze frame of the formation for 0.5 seconds, ending with the final footstep/impact. Overall: Neon high-saturation cool/warm contrast, shallow depth of field to highlight movement, no text logo watermark.

  ---
  Version 2: Ancient Chinese Style · Flute Melody (Artistic Beat Sync)

Seedance 2.0 Prompt

  10-second Guofeng MV beat-sync shots, 9:16 vertical screen, ink wash painting style. 0-2 sec: Fixed extreme long shot, a woman in white facing away from the camera plays a guqin deep in a bamboo forest, smoke slowly rises from beneath the instrument, bamboo leaves tremble slightly with the sound of the zither; 3-4 sec: Camera slowly pushes in in slow motion to the woman's profile, her eyelashes flutter slightly, a smile at the corner of her mouth, the zither strings vibrate under her fingers, background is blurred; 5-7 sec: The moment the woman looks up at the camera, the scene cuts precisely on the beat—countless pink petals fall from the void, the camera slowly rotates 360 degrees to show the stunning scene of petals swirling, every petal clearly visible; 8-9 sec: Camera pulls back to the extreme long shot, the woman turns to face the camera, her robes fluttering in the wind, the bamboo forest behind her glows gold in the sunset, she gently touches the guqin strings and freezes; 10 sec: The scene gradually transitions into an ink wash effect, finally concluding with the lingering sound of the guqin and the rustling of bamboo leaves.

  ---
  Version 3: Electronic Future Bass · Neon Rainy Night (Cyber Beat Sync)

 Seedance 2.0 Prompt

  10-second Electronic Future Bass MV beat-sync shots, ultra-widescreen, neon city night view. 0-1 sec: Fixed shot, neon lights reflecting on the wet street of a rainy night city, cyberpunk buildings reflected in puddles, the visual rhythm slightly shaking in sync with the low-frequency Bass; 2-4 sec: Camera quickly pushes forward along the street, passing through the rain curtain, every drop of rain splashes up on the Bass heavy beat, camera speed fluctuates with the music rhythm; 5-7 sec: Cuts into a character's perspective, a girl wearing headphones dances in the rain, her movements perfectly sync with the Bass—her body freezes for one frame on every heavy beat creating a sense of pause, neon lights form light trails on her, raindrops are shattered in the air by the music; 8-9 sec: Camera quickly zooms out and pans up, overlooking the entire neon street, the visual ripple of the Bass in the rain spreads out in circles from the center of the street, each ripple precisely corresponding to a heavy beat; 10 sec: The scene freezes in the overhead view, the street view instantly reverses to black and white on the final beat and then fades to black, concluding with the aftershock of the Bass and the gradual fading of the rain sound.

### Modern Rural Aesthetics Healing Short Film Video Prompt

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, three-shot prompt for Seedance 2.0 to generate a healing, cinematic short film in the Modern Rural Aesthetics style. It specifies the style (Cinematic Commercial, 4K/8K, Extreme Macro, natural light, ASMR), the setting (a modern open kitchen with a garden view), the character (a focused creator in linen), and specific actions for three scenes: picking a tomato, precise cutting, and a quiet moment of eating.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
[Style]
Modern Rural Aesthetics, Cinematic Commercial quality, shot with Sony A7S3/cinema camera, 4K/8K ultra-clear, Extreme Macro, natural transparent lighting, healing ASMR, no historical costume drama feel.

[Scene]
A well-maintained modern farmhouse open kitchen, background is a lush vegetable garden, bright sunshine.

[Character]
Modern Rural Creator, black long hair casually tied up with a wooden hairpin, wearing a dark blue comfortable linen outfit, clear makeup, focused and peaceful eyes.

[Shot Details]
[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Morning Harvest (The Freshness)
Visuals: High-definition close-up. Morning sunlight hits the plants with side backlighting.
Action: The Creator's bare hands (long, clean fingers) pick a bright red tomato with glistening dew drops from the vine.
Details: Extremely sharp focus, clearly showing the fuzz on the tomato surface and the trajectory of sliding water droplets. Background is blurred high-quality green.

[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Extreme Craftsmanship (The Craft)
Visuals: Indoor stove area, full of life but spotless.
Action: The Creator is cutting vegetables, movements are skilled and precise (non-performance nature).
Details: Macro lens captures the moment the knife blade slices through the ingredients, juice splattering. Then switches to the orange flame flickering in the earthen stove, light and shadow are warm and real.

[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Tranquil Time (The Moment)
Visuals: Full shot/Medium shot.
Action: A delicate home-cooked dish is placed on the wooden long table in the yard. The Creator sits down quietly, gently tidies a stray hair, and picks up a bite of food.
Atmosphere: Steam slowly rises against the backlight, the scene is so quiet you can almost hear the wind, showcasing the ultimate sense of relaxation modern people yearn for.

### Demon Slayer Live-Action Blockbuster Video Prompt

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, three-shot prompt for Seedance 2.0 to generate a hyper-realistic, Hollywood-style live-action adaptation of Demon Slayer (Kimetsu no Yaiba). The prompt specifies the style (IMAX, 8K, Photorealistic, Dark Fantasy, Unreal Engine 5), the setting (misty forest), and three distinct action scenes focusing on realistic physics and effects: Hyper-realistic Fluid Simulation for Water Breathing, Real Plasma Arcs for Thunderclap and Flash, and a Physics Clash with massive particle explosion.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
[Style] Hollywood Live-Action Blockbuster, IMAX film quality, 8K ultra-clear, Photorealistic, Dark Fantasy, Unreal Engine 5 realistic rendering, no anime feel.
[Duration] 15 seconds
[Scene] A real misty forest under the moonlight, the ground is wet soil and real fallen leaves.

[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Live-Action Interpretation · Water Breathing (Realistic Water FX).
[Close-up] An Asian teenage swordsman (real actor's facial pores visible), wearing a green and black checkered coarse cloth haori (clear fabric texture).
Action: He holds the sword with both hands under the moonlight, lowering his center of gravity.
Special Effects: As he breathes, no cartoon water flow appears on the blade, but rather **highly realistic, transparent, and glowing pressurized high-pressure water flow (Hyper-realistic Fluid Simulation)** condenses. The water flow wraps around the real blade like a living dragon, water droplets splash onto the lens, reflecting the moonlight.

[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Thunderclap and Flash · Extreme Speed (Lightning Plasma).
[Medium Shot/High-Speed Photography] Opposite him is a young swordsman with dyed blonde hair (real hair strands floating), wearing a yellow triangular patterned fabric jacket.
Action: He performs the starting stance for an Iaijutsu draw, the soil beneath his feet explodes due to the force.
Special Effects: **Real, blinding blue-white electric current (Real Plasma Arcs)** erupts in the air, not yellow cartoon lightning. The current strikes through the surrounding real trees, leaving scorched marks.

[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Fateful Duel · Physics Clash (Physics Clash).
[Slow Motion/Big Explosion] The two collide at extreme speed in the center of the frame.
Action: The solid water flow greatsword violently clashes with the lightning light blade.
Special Effects: No comic lines, only **real physical particle explosion**. Large amounts of water vapor, mud, broken branches, and dazzling electric sparks scatter in the air. The shockwave lifts circles of real ripples from the standing water beneath their feet. The scene possesses great weight and destructive power.

### Horror Short Film Prompt: The Glitch in the Mirror

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-shot prompt for a 15-second pseudo-documentary/horror short film about a young woman brushing her teeth, where her reflection in the mirror exhibits independent, unsettling behavior, creating a suspenseful 'glitch' effect.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
[Style] Pseudo-documentary (Vlog Style), hyperrealism, fixed camera shot feeling, natural light, with a touch of suspense and horror. 
[Duration] 15 seconds 
[Protagonist (remember to upload reference image)] A sexy young woman preparing to wash up and go to bed in front of the sink in her bathroom. 
[00:00-00:06] Shot 1: Normalcy. Scene: In front of a large ordinary bathroom mirror. Action: The protagonist is brushing her teeth in the mirror, mouth full of foam. She makes various funny faces at the mirror while brushing (winking and grimacing). Key Detail: At this point, the reflection in the mirror is completely normal, and the movements are synchronized. 
[00:06-00:11] Shot 2: The Glitch. Action: The protagonist finishes brushing her teeth, spits out the foam, and turns to leave the bathroom. Climax (Core Highlight): Just as the protagonist's real body has turned and left the mirror frame, the “reflection” in the mirror surprisingly **does not move**! The “reflection” remains in the brushing posture, even smirking and winking at the camera, staying for a full 2 seconds before suddenly “flickering” in panic to catch up with the body's movement and disappear. Director's Note: Must create an extremely realistic “network lag” feeling, giving the reflection a sense of independent consciousness. 
[00:11-00:15] Shot 3: The Punchline. Action: The protagonist, who has reached the door, seems to sense something is wrong and suddenly turns back to look at the mirror. Result: The mirror has completely returned to normal, empty, reflecting only the opposite wall. The protagonist looks bewildered and scared, glances around the room, and shows a look of horror. The scene freezes on the protagonist's confused face (horror movie effect).

### Political Satire Short Film: The 'Nothing' Hero's Ride

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-scene prompt for Seedance 2.0, structured as a short film script with dialogue and camera instructions, depicting a satirical narrative. A confident figure on horseback rides through a wealthy neighborhood, expecting a warm welcome, only to be completely ignored by a crowd rushing past him to a Chinese steamed bun shop, leading to a moment of self-mockery and a defiant ending.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
Scene 1: Galloping Horse + Enthusiastic Crowd Approaching (0:00-0:08, 8 seconds)
• Location: Main winding road in a Vancouver mansion district (wide asphalt road, large detached mansions on both sides, thin snow covering evergreen pine trees)
• Subject: A rider in a dark suit galloping at full speed, white horse's hooves airborne, mane flying
• Environment: Light snow falling, mansions flashing past, outline of the North Shore mountains and ocean in the distance
• Crowd: A large group of enthusiastic supporters suddenly appears ahead (diverse young people), waving yellow dragon flags + “Nothing” signs, shouting cheers, surging towards the rider
• Camera: Front medium-speed follow shot → Switch to rider's perspective (POV), the crowd gets closer and closer
• Atmosphere: Climax continues, the rider has a confident smile, preparing to rein in (hand already raised towards the reins, relaxed posture, corner of the mouth lifted)
Scene 2: Reversal—The crowd passes directly through, ignoring the rider (0:08-0:14, 6 seconds)
• Location: Same road, a Chinese steamed bun shop appears around the corner (sign “Qingfeng Baozi Shop,” warm lighting, simple plastic tables and chairs in the outdoor area, steam rising)
• Subject: The rider is about to wave in greeting, but the crowd ignores him, rushing past him on both sides/around him, heading to queue/pour into the bun shop entrance
• Action: The rider's smile freezes, his hand stops mid-air, his expression changes from anticipation to shock/disarray (wind messes up his hair, the hem of his suit jacket swings)
• Details: The crowd shouts “Baozi! Baozi!”, yellow dragon flags wave chaotically, the “Nothing” sign is pushed aside; the white horse is forced to take small steps to stop or step aside
• Camera: Quick pan/wide-angle shot, showing the crowd flowing like a tide around the rider (the horse is “passed through” in the center of the frame), the rider remains isolated in the middle
• Atmosphere: Absurd reversal, awkward disarray, black humor climax
Scene 3: Eating buns and dialogue outside the bun shop (0:14-0:20, 6 seconds)
• Location: Qingfeng Baozi Shop outdoor area (plastic tables and chairs, steaming baskets, mansion district road in the background)
• Subject: Two ordinary young people (wearing down jackets) sitting in the queue area, eating buns heartily
• Action: One person takes a bite of the bun, closes their eyes in satisfaction, “Ah, so delicious.” (Close-up shot of the steam/juice from the bitten bun)
• Dialogue:

First person (eating while looking towards the road): Who was that?
Second person (thoughtfully, chewing the bun, looking into the distance): Nothing.
• Camera: Medium shot of the two people → Slight push-in on facial expressions (satisfied + calm), the rider's receding figure is faintly visible in the background
• Atmosphere: Down-to-earth, contrasting cuteness, emphasizing the theme of “nothing”

Scene 4: The rider mocks himself, continues to ride away (0:20-0:30, 10 seconds)
• Location: Wide extending road in the mansion district (straight ahead, mansions gradually receding)
• Subject: The rider on the horse, his expression changes from disarray to a confident smile
• Action: He reaches into the breast pocket of his suit, pulls out a packaged sandwich, takes a fierce bite (juice/crumbs splatter), then shakes his head with a dashing smile, lightly whips the white horse with the reins, and continues galloping forward
• Environment: The mansion cluster shrinks in the background, the evergreen trees and supporters on both sides of the road (now stopped) can only wave from afar, the Vancouver-style mountain and sea skyline in the distance (misty snow)
• Details: White horse's tail swings, hoof prints left on the lightly snowy road, clear bite mark on the sandwich, the rider smiles confidently
• Camera: From close-up (sandwich bite close-up) → Slowly pulls back to an extreme long shot, low-angle filming, reinforcing the sense of an aloof hero who “doesn't care”; finally fades out.
• Atmosphere: Self-mocking yet dashing, heroic and unrestrained, symbolic ending (“Nothing” can still move forward)
```

### The Flash Director's Prompt

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, multi-part 'Director’s Prompt' used with Seedance 2.0 via ChatCut, describing a complex, dynamic, and cinematic sequence featuring The Flash accelerating and creating a time portal.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
Opening Shot:
Extreme close-up on The Flash’s boots touching wet asphalt at night. Raindrops freeze midair as time slows. Golden lightning begins to crawl over his suit, crackling softly.
Camera: Low-angle, slow push-in.
As he leans forward, the world stretches and distorts. On the beat, he launches. The camera snaps into pursuit as he explodes forward in a blinding burst of red and gold lightning, tearing through the city streets. Buildings smear into light trails, traffic lights become streaks of color, thunder rolling underneath the sound design.

DIRECTOR’S PROMPT — PART 2

The Flash accelerates beyond the city, racing across highways, deserts, and oceans in seconds. The curvature of the Earth becomes visible as clouds rip apart beneath him.
Camera: Dynamic tracking shot with heavy motion blur, lightning arcing outward like veins of energy.
Time fractures — day and night collapse into one continuous run. As he reaches maximum velocity, the lightning intensifies into near-white brilliance. He vanishes in a final thunderous flash, leaving only scorched air, fading electricity, and silence.

DIRECTOR’S PROMPT — PART 3

A low, resonant hum builds. The air ahead fractures like glass. A circular portal forms — ancient, unstable — glowing with swirling light and dust, as if time itself is being torn open.
```
