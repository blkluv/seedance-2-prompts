### Horror/Suspense Vlog Style Video Prompt: The Mirror Glitch

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-scene video generation prompt for Seedance 2.0 in a pseudo-documentary (Vlog) style, focusing on a suspenseful scenario where a mirror reflection exhibits independent, glitch-like behavior, requiring a reference image for the main character.

```
[Style] Pseudo-documentary (Vlog Style), hyperrealism, fixed camera shot feel, natural light, with a touch of suspense and horror. 
[Duration] 15 seconds 
[Protagonist (Remember to upload a reference image)] A sexy young woman preparing to wash up and sleep in front of the sink in her bathroom. 
[00:00-00:06] Scene 1: Normalcy. Setting: In front of a large ordinary bathroom mirror. Action: The protagonist is brushing her teeth, mouth full of foam. She makes various funny faces at the mirror while brushing (winking and grimacing). Key Detail: The reflection in the mirror is completely normal and synchronized. 
[00:06-00:11] Scene 2: The Glitch. Action: The protagonist finishes brushing, spits out the foam, and turns to leave the bathroom. High-Energy Moment (Core Climax): Just as the protagonist's real body has turned and left the mirror's frame, the “reflection” in the mirror **does not move**! The “reflection” remains in the brushing posture, even smirking and winking at the camera. It stays for a full 2 seconds before suddenly “screen-flashing” in panic to catch up with the body's movement and disappearing. Director's Note: Must create an extremely realistic “network latency” feel, giving the impression that the reflection has an independent consciousness. 
[00:11-00:15] Scene 3: The Punchline. Action: The protagonist, who has reached the door, seems to sense something is wrong and quickly turns back to look at the mirror. Result: The mirror has completely returned to normal, empty, only reflecting the opposite wall. The protagonist looks confused and scared, glances around the room, and shows a horrified expression. The scene freezes on the protagonist's bewildered face (horror movie effect).
```

### Absurd Reversal: Politician Ignored for Steamed Buns

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-scene video prompt for Seedance 2.0, featuring a high-stakes political scene that takes an absurd, humorous turn when the enthusiastic crowd ignores the main character to rush a steamed bun shop. The prompt specifies locations, character actions, camera movements, and atmosphere for each of the four scenes.

```
Scene 1: Horse Galloping + Enthusiastic Crowd Approaching (0:00-0:08, 8 seconds)
• Location: Main winding road in a Vancouver mansion district (wide asphalt road, large detached mansions on both sides, evergreen pine trees covered with light snow)
• Subject: A rider in a dark suit galloping at full speed on a white horse, the horse's four hooves airborne, mane flying
• Environment: Light snow falling, mansions flashing past, outline of the North Shore mountains and ocean in the distance
• Crowd: A large group of enthusiastic supporters suddenly appears ahead (diverse young people), waving yellow dragon flags + “Nothing” signs, shouting and cheering, surging towards the rider
• Camera: Front medium-speed follow-shot → Switch to the rider's perspective (POV), the crowd getting closer
• Atmosphere: Climax continues, the rider has a confident smile, preparing to rein in (hand already raised to the reins, relaxed posture, corners of the mouth turned up)
Scene 2: Reversal—The crowd passes directly through, ignoring the rider (0:08-0:14, 6 seconds)
• Location: Same road, a Chinese steamed bun shop appears at the corner (sign “Qingfeng Baozi Shop”, warm lighting, simple plastic tables and chairs in the outdoor seating area, steam rising)
• Subject: The rider is about to wave in greeting, but the crowd ignores him, rushing past him on both sides/around him, heading for the queue/entering the bun shop entrance
• Action: The rider's smile freezes, his hand stops mid-air, his expression changes from anticipation to shock/disarray (wind messes up his hair, the hem of his suit jacket flutters)
• Details: The crowd shouts “Baozi! Baozi!”, yellow dragon flags wave chaotically, the “Nothing” sign is pushed aside; the white horse is forced to take small steps or turn aside to avoid the crowd
• Camera: Quick pan/wide shot, showing the crowd flowing like a tide around the rider (the horse is “passed through” in the center of the frame), the rider is left alone in the middle
• Atmosphere: Absurd reversal, awkward disarray, black humor climax
Scene 3: Eating buns and dialogue outside the bun shop (0:14-0:20, 6 seconds)
• Location: Qingfeng Baozi Shop outdoor seating area (plastic tables and chairs, steaming baskets, mansion district road in the background)
• Subject: Two ordinary young people (wearing down jackets) sitting in the queue seats, eating buns heartily
• Action: One person takes a bite of a bun, closes their eyes in satisfaction, “Ah, so delicious.” (Close-up shot of the bun being bitten open, showing steam/juice)
• Dialogue:

First person (eating while looking towards the road): Who is that?
Second person (thoughtfully, chewing the bun, looking into the distance): Nothing.
• Camera: Medium shot of two people → Slight push-in on facial expressions (satisfied + calm), the faint silhouette of the rider walking away is visible in the background
• Atmosphere: Down-to-earth, contrasting cuteness, referencing the theme “nothing”

Scene 4: The rider laughs at himself, continues on his way (0:20-0:30, 10 seconds)
• Location: Wide, extending road in the mansion district (straight ahead, the mansion cluster gradually receding)
• Subject: The rider on the horse, his expression changing from disarray to a confident smile
• Action: He reaches into his suit chest pocket, pulls out a packaged sandwich, takes a big bite (juice/crumbs splatter), then shakes his head with a dashing smile, lightly taps the white horse with the reins, and continues galloping forward
• Environment: The mansion cluster gradually shrinks in the background, the evergreen trees on both sides of the road and the supporters (now stopped) can only be seen waving from afar, the Vancouver-style mountain-sea skyline in the distance (misty with snow)
• Details: The white horse's tail swings, hoof prints are left on the lightly snow-covered road, the bite mark on the sandwich is clear, the rider smiles confidently
• Camera: From close-up (sandwich bite special shot) → Slowly pulls back to an extreme long shot, low-angle shooting, emphasizing the “I don't care” isolated heroic feeling; finally fades out.
```

### Surreal Battlefield Ronin Action Scene Prompt

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed creative description for an action scene featuring a masked ronin battling a colossal winged beast on floating rock islands in a thunderstorm, specifying camera movements, effects, and the dramatic finale.

```
A surreal battlefield in the sky: floating rock islands drifting through a thunderstorm, clouds swirling below like an ocean. The masked ronin dashes across the drifting platforms, pursued by a colossal winged beast whose chest is a swirling vortex of storm clouds and lightning. The camera hurtles from island to island, struggling to keep up as rocks tilt, spin, and crumble away beneath them. Every wingbeat sends shockwaves through the air, shaking the frame and blowing debris and rain straight into the viewer’s face. Rapid handheld cuts capture the ronin leaping impossible gaps, sword carving arcs of light that briefly cut through the darkness. The finale shows the camera diving behind him as he jumps off the last crumbling rock, riding a bolt of lightning directly into the monster’s chest vortex with a final, all-or-nothing slash that explodes the storm from within and clears the sky in a blinding flash.
```

### Director's Prompt: The Flash Speed Sequence

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A detailed, multi-part 'Director's Prompt' for Seedance 2.0 via ChatCut, describing a cinematic sequence featuring The Flash accelerating, with specific camera angles, visual effects (lightning, motion blur), and scene transitions (city, highway, portal formation).

```
Opening Shot:
Extreme close-up on The Flash’s boots touching wet asphalt at night. Raindrops freeze midair as time slows. Golden lightning begins to crawl over his suit, crackling softly.
Camera: Low-angle, slow push-in.
As he leans forward, the world stretches and distorts. On the beat, he launches. The camera snaps into pursuit as he explodes forward in a blinding burst of red and gold lightning, tearing through the city streets. Buildings smear into light trails, traffic lights become streaks of color, thunder rolling underneath the sound design.

DIRECTOR’S PROMPT — PART 2

The Flash accelerates beyond the city, racing across highways, deserts, and oceans in seconds. The curvature of the Earth becomes visible as clouds rip apart beneath him.
Camera: Dynamic tracking shot with heavy motion blur, lightning arcing outward like veins of energy.
Time fractures — day and night collapse into one continuous run. As he reaches maximum velocity, the lightning intensifies into near-white brilliance. He vanishes in a final thunderous flash, leaving only scorched air, fading electricity, and silence.

DIRECTOR’S PROMPT — PART 3

A low, resonant hum builds. The air ahead fractures like glass. A circular portal forms — ancient, unstable — glowing with swirling light and dust, as if time itself is being torn open.
```

### One Piece 1174 Inspired Text-to-Video Prompt

![日本語](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-日本語-green)

> A detailed text-to-video prompt for Seedance 2.0, inspired by a chapter of One Piece (1174). The prompt describes a dramatic scene where child hostages are falling into the sea, a villain's callous remark, and the sudden appearance of Loki transforming into a giant black dragon to save them. The scene concludes with Loki, Gear 5 Luffy, and Ragnir in squirrel form preparing to attack MMA monsters.

```
The child hostages cannot stop walking and steadily approach the edge of the harbor and the hole opened in the sea clouds by the destruction of the ship.
Sommers says, "I don't care if they die; I can just kidnap other giant children later." Ripley and the children's families desperately try to stop them, but realizing they can't, they embrace the children—and they all fall. But...!!!
Loki appears and saves them.
He transforms into a giant black dragon and grabs everyone from the sky (Loki's Devil Fruit name is not revealed in this chapter). The chapter ends with Loki in dragon form, Gear 5 Luffy, and Ragnir in squirrel form riding on Loki's head, ready to launch an attack on the MMA monsters.
```

### Live-Action Anime Adaptation: Water vs. Thunder Breathing

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A highly detailed, three-scene video prompt for Seedance 2.0, generating a 15-second, high-octane battle between two characters using 'Water Breathing' (blue water dragon) and 'Thunder Breathing' (golden lightning) techniques, inspired by anime but rendered in a Hollywood live-action style.

```
Live-Action Anime Adaptation · Breathing Technique Decisive Battle (15 seconds · Super Burning Special Effects Version)
【Core Focus】: Water Breathing (Blue Water Dragon) VS Thunder Breathing (Golden Lightning), live-action high-speed duel.

【Style】: Hollywood live-action anime movie texture, dark samurai style, 4K ultra-clear, extreme fast cuts, explosive particle light effects, no gore.
【Duration】: 15 seconds
【Scene】: Misty forest under the moonlight, muddy ground, scattered falling leaves.

[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Water Melody Prelude (Sense of Power Accumulation)
Visuals: A young samurai in a green and black checkered haori (jacket) lowers his center of gravity under the moonlight, gripping his sword with both hands.
Action: He takes a deep breath, and the surrounding air instantly solidifies. As he draws his sword, a huge blue water dragon, condensed from high-pressure water flow, appears out of thin air, rotating rapidly around his body and blade, emitting the roar of flowing water.
Special Effects Details: The water flow has a realistic sense of splashing water, illuminating the dark forest.

[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Thunder Flash · Charge (Sense of Extreme Speed)
Visuals: The opponent, a blonde swordsman wearing a yellow triangle-patterned haori, is crouched extremely low, adopting the posture of an Iaijutsu (sword drawing technique).
Action: The ground suddenly explodes, and he instantly transforms into a dazzling golden lightning afterimage, rapidly refracting and charging through the forest in a 'Z' shape at a speed undetectable by the naked eye.
Special Effects Details: Golden electric arcs and scorched fallen leaves remain in the air where he passed.

[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Water and Thunder Collision · Final Note (Ultimate Move Clash)
Visuals: Extreme speed confrontation. The young samurai swings the massive blue water dragon down to meet the charge, and the blonde swordsman, transformed into lightning, crashes into it head-on.
Action: The two swords violently collide at the center of the frame.
Special Effects Spectacle: The blue water dragon and the golden lightning instantly explode, forming a massive water-thunder energy storm that spreads outward. The surrounding trees are snapped in half by the energy wave, and mud and light obscure the camera. The scene ends in an intensely dazzling blue, yellow, and white light.
```

### High-Energy Xianxia Animation Battle Scene Video Prompt

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed video generation prompt for Seedance 2.0, creating a 15-second high-energy duel between the characters Han Li and Wang Lin in a Chinese Xianxia animation style, focusing on intense visual contrast and dynamic action sequences.

```
Chinese Xianxia animation film style, ultra-fine 3D CG rendering, 15-second high-energy duel scene, strong contrast with gold and cyan dual color tones. 0-3 seconds: Extreme long shot, two streams of light rapidly collide from both sides of the screen in chaotic void—in the golden light on the left, a middle-aged cultivator in a greenish-gray robe is vaguely visible, his face calm like water, holding a small green sword, this is Han Li; in the cyan-black malevolence on the right, a thin man with white hair and a black robe stands with his hands behind his back, his eyes deep like ancient wells, surrounded by world-destroying aura, this is Wang Lin. The two look at each other from a distance, the void cracks due to the collision of their auras, accompanied by low thunder. 4-8 seconds: Han Li performs hand seals to activate the Azure Bamboo Cloud-Swarm Swords. Seventy-two flying swords transform into a golden storm of sword rain sweeping forward; Wang Lin points with his right hand, and a massive cyan giant hand illusion that covers the sky condenses behind him. The giant hand slaps down against the sword rain. The moment the sword energy and palm force collide, a golden and cyan energy torrent erupts. The shockwave spreads in all directions, tearing the void, accompanied by the sound of metal collision and space shattering. 9-12 seconds: Freeze-frame slow motion. A golden illusion of ten thousand Buddhas appears behind Han Li, his eyes burst with golden light, and Ten Thousand Swords Return to One condenses into a hundred-zhang golden sword light that strikes straight down; a hint of madness flashes in Wang Lin's eyes, and he roars, "If heaven does not tolerate me, I will defy this heaven!". He raises his right hand high, and a spinning black sphere condenses in his palm, emitting a destructive aura that warps space. The two ultimate forces collide head-on, and time seems to stand still. 13-15 seconds: Massive energy explosion. The screen is swallowed by white light and slowly dissipates. In the dust, two figures stand back-to-back in the shattered void, their robes tattered, both gasping for breath. Han Li speaks faintly, "I admire your heaven-defying technique, Fellow Daoist Wang." A smile appears at the corner of Wang Lin's mouth. The sound effects fade into the crisp sound of void fragments falling and a weakening wind.
```

### Seedance 2.0 'Awakening · Future' Cinematic Prompt

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A comprehensive, multi-shot cinematic prompt for Seedance 2.0 designed to create a high-impact, 10-second Hollywood-style commercial video with a cyberpunk aesthetic, focusing on a transformation from an ancient goddess to a futuristic warrior.

```
【Film Settings】Cinematic quality, IMAX aspect ratio, ARRI Alexa 65mm, high contrast, cyberpunk aesthetic, 8K resolution.

【Core Concept】Space-time folding. A transformation from an ancient, pure Salt Lake Goddess instantly awakening into a neon warrior of the future city.

Shot 1: Full shot, slow push-in. The scene is extremely still. A young woman wears red and white ethnic attire, adorned with silver jewelry, standing in the mirror-like white salt lake. The sunlight is sacred, with continuous snow-capped mountains in the background. The wind blows her clothes, full of divinity.

Shot 2: Extreme Close-Up (ECU), match cut. The camera rapidly pushes into the woman's eyes. Her pupils instantly dilate, reflecting backward-flowing digital streams and blue data light effects.

Shot 3: Jump cut, glitch art interference. The screen is instantly torn apart by intense neon light. The white salt lake background instantly transforms into a flashing holographic billboard of a cyber city on a rainy night.

Shot 4: Medium shot, low-angle upward shot. Visual impact. She still stands in the center of the frame, but her ethnic robe has transformed into high-tech reflective functional clothing. The original silver headpiece has become metallic, flowing headphones.

Shot 5: Close-up, light and shadow shifting. Rain falls on her face, reflecting pink and purple neon lights. She gives a cold smile to the camera, reaches out to put on goggles, and her aura is fully unleashed.

Shot 6: Extreme Long Shot, freeze frame. She stands atop a skyscraper, overlooking the entire steel jungle, with a giant holographic projection of a whale swimming behind her. Subtitle: “Awakening · Future”.

Duration: 10 seconds | Style: Top Hollywood commercial film | Visual Impact: Extremely strong
```

### Cinematic Aerial Wingsuit Flight Prompt

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> An extremely detailed, cinematic prompt for an aerial video sequence, starting with a wide shot of a snow-covered mountain peak and transitioning into a high-speed, proximity wingsuit flight through ice formations and a glacial valley.

```
A cinematic video sequence opening with a serene wide aerial shot of a pristine snow-covered mountain peak at dawn, the summit piercing through a sea of clouds with alpenglow painting the ice formations pink and gold. The camera transitions to follow a wingsuit pilot who leaps from the peak, immediately entering a steep vertical dive through wispy clouds. The tracking shot positions just behind and above the pilot as they accelerate downward, the camera shaking subtly from air turbulence, frost particles streaming past. The pilot pulls into a proximity flight, skimming within meters of sheer cliff faces and jagged ice formations, the camera banking and rolling to match every precise movement. Shadows and light play across the wingsuit's surface as the pilot threads through a narrow ice chimney, walls rushing past in a blur of blue and white. Speed intensifies as they enter a massive glacial valley, weaving between enormous ice pillars and frozen waterfalls, mist and powder snow kicked up in spiraling trails. The pilot executes a dramatic barrel roll around a freestanding ice spire before pulling the parachute at the last possible moment. The camera follows upward through the deceleration, then pulls wide to reveal a breathtaking hidden alpine lake surrounded by untouched snow fields, perfectly still and mirror-like, reflecting the morning sky.
```

### Seedance 2.0 Prompting Techniques and Templates

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A comprehensive guide to writing effective Seedance 2.0 prompts, including a universal formula (Subject + Action + Scene + Lighting + Camera Language + Style + Quality + Constraints), tips for describing actions and camera movements, stabilization techniques, and two ready-to-use templates for portrait and landscape videos.

```
① Universal Formula

Subject + Action + Scene + Lighting + Camera Language + Style + Quality + Constraints

Example:
A young girl walking slowly by the sea, hair gently moved by the breeze, natural smile, warm light at sunset, medium shot, slow push-in, stable and smooth footage, 4K high definition, cinematic feel, clear face without deformation.

② Action Description

Don't just write: walking / dancing
Write: slow + continuous + natural

Priority words:
slow, gentle, natural, continuous, smooth, not stiff

Useful combinations:
slow turn / gently raise hand / slightly lower head / sway with the wind

③ Camera Language

Seedance is very strong at recognizing camera movements, remember to write:

Close-up / Medium Shot / Special Shot
Slow push-in / slight pull-out / smooth horizontal pan / stable follow-shot

Example:
Medium shot, slow push-in, stable follow-shot, smooth footage without stuttering

④ Anti-face change / Anti-deformation

Very important:

Clear face, stable features, no deformation
Normal human structure, natural proportions
Same character, consistent clothing, unchanged hairstyle

⑤ General words for quality enhancement

4K, ultra-high definition, rich details, sharp clarity
Cinematic feel, soft light and shadow, natural colors
No blur, no flicker, stable footage

⑥ Style / Atmosphere words

Healing and fresh / Japanese style / Korean atmosphere
Retro film grain / dreamy soft light / cyberpunk
Minimalist clean / high-end texture

⑦ Multi-shot writing (Advanced usage)

Describe in sequence, do not break up randomly:

Start with close-up of face → slow pull-out → character walks slowly → camera follows smoothly → end with a freeze-frame smile

⑧ Avoidance Guide

❌ Intense running/jumping / complex multi-person interaction
❌ Vague words: good-looking / very beautiful / very cool
❌ Contradictory requirements: ultra-high speed + extreme stability

⑨ Templates that can be copied directly

Portrait atmosphere short video
A young girl walking slowly in the forest, hair gently moved by the breeze, natural smile, medium shot, slow push-in, stable and smooth footage, 4K high definition, cinematic feel, clear face without deformation.

Landscape atmosphere
Sunset by the sea, waves gently lapping the beach, camera slowly panning horizontally, warm orange tones, smooth footage, 4K ultra-high definition, no flicker or ghosting.

⑩ Summary of Tips

1️⃣ Write actions slowly and continuously
2️⃣ Write camera movements stably and simply
3️⃣ Must add stable / no deformation / not stiff
4️⃣ Quality & style are added last
5️⃣ Less complexity, more precision
```

### Sun Wukong vs. Goku: Cross-Style Dimensional Clash

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A complex, multi-scene video prompt for Seedance 2.0 (Jimen/Xiaoyunque) detailing a 15-second cross-style battle between the classic Chinese mythological Sun Wukong and the Japanese anime character Super Saiyan Goku. The prompt specifies the visual contrast, dialogue, special effects (Kamehameha, Ruyi Jingu Bang), and the final scene where the two styles merge into a new world.

```
15-second cross-style duel shot, with a sharp contrast between the Japanese anime cel-style on the left and the Chinese mythological realistic style on the right. 0-3 seconds: Extreme long shot, a dimensional rift descends from the center of the frame, splitting the scene in two—on the left is the red rocky wasteland typical of Dragon Ball, with Super Saiyan Goku in golden hair standing with one hand on his hip, his orange battle suit tightly defining his muscle lines, surrounded by the golden Super Saiyan electric aura; on the right is the cloud-shrouded Flower and Fruit Mountain, with the classical Sun Wukong in chain mail, phoenix-winged purple-gold helmet, and holding the Ruyi Jingu Bang, standing on the mountain peak, surrounded by auspicious clouds. The two look at each other across the rift, the edge of the rift flickers unstably due to the style conflict, accompanied by a low sound of spacetime distortion. 4-8 seconds: Both speak simultaneously—Anime Goku: "You look a lot like me, buddy!" with a hot-blooded anime boy voice; Classical Wukong: "Bold demon monkey, how dare you steal my name!" with a deep operatic voice. The two rush out of the rift and cross paths. Anime Goku unleashes a Kamehameha wave of pink-blue energy, and Classical Wukong swings the Jingu Bang in a sweeping strike. The moment the energy wave and the Jingu Bang collide, a style-tearing effect occurs—the intersection of the two forces pixelates and flickers, color blocks collapse and reorganize, accompanied by the angry roar of the Kamehameha "Ka-me-ha-me-HA" and the whistling sound of the Jingu Bang cutting through the air. 9-12 seconds: Freeze-frame slow motion. Anime Goku activates Ultra Instinct, his body shrouded in silver-gray aura, his eyes turning calm silver-gray, his movements flashing like lightning as he appears behind Classical Wukong; Classical Wukong's Fiery Eyes and Golden Pupils suddenly light up with golden-red light, his body transforms into an afterimage using the Dharma Heaven and Earth technique—his body swells to a hundred zhang (hundreds of feet) tall, and the Jingu Bang in his hand simultaneously enlarges like a pillar supporting the sky, smashing down. 13-15 seconds: The lightning-fast punches of the silver-gray aura and the sky-high Jingu Bang collide head-on in the center of the frame. The shockwave tears the dimensional rift, and the Dragon Ball wasteland and Flower and Fruit Mountain are simultaneously swallowed by the energy torrent. After a flash of white light, the smoke and dust clear, and two figures stand back-to-back in the merged new world—a strange terrain mixing mountains and wasteland. Anime Goku scratches his head and laughs, saying, "That was some powerful stuff, let's fight again next time." Classical Wukong lightly strokes his monkey whiskers and nods, "I'll find another place to play next time." The sound effects converge into the hearty laughter of the two simultaneously and the fading sound of the wind.
```

### Northeast China MC Livestream Cyberpunk Prompt

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-shot prompt for Seedance 2.0 to generate a vertical-screen (9:16) video in the style of a high-end, cyberpunk-neon livestream studio, featuring a 'Northeast Sweet Girl' MC performing a slow-roll dance, accompanied by two cool bodyguards. The prompt specifies the visual style, music, character details, and shot breakdown for a highly rhythmic and glamorous atmosphere.

```
【Style】Douyin/Kuaishou vertical screen (TikTok Portrait 9:16), high-end influencer livestream studio (High-end Livestream Studio), cyberpunk neon light, 4K quality, Northeast MC Slow Roll style (Dongbei MC Slow Roll), extremely strong sense of rhythm.
【Duration】15 seconds
【BGM Setting】“Night Paris” DJ Slow Roll version.
【Characters】
1. Protagonist: Northeast Sweet Girl, extremely sweet and cute appearance (twin pigtails/big eyes), but dressed in a “sweet and cool style” (pink fuzzy jacket + tight camisole), wearing huge rhinestone headphones, holding a professional condenser microphone.
2. Supporting Roles: Two black-clad subordinates (Backups), wearing sunglasses, expressionless, standing on the left and right sides behind the sweet girl, cool like bodyguards.

[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Sweet Girl Starts the Vibe (The Intro).
Visuals: Lights focus on the sweet girl's face. She smiles sweetly at the camera, then her eyes instantly become sharp (entering MC state).
Action: Following the heavy bass rhythm of “boom-chick-a-boom”, she presses one hand against her headphones and starts swaying rhythmically left and right (Swaying).
Background: The two black-clad subordinates behind her synchronously start nodding and shaking their shoulders, movements perfectly aligned, creating a strong sense of pressure.
【Atmosphere】High-end, hazy, decadent.

[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Night Paris Climax (The Climax).
Visuals: The large screen in the background of the livestream studio displays brilliant neon words “Night Paris” and a laser projection of the Eiffel Tower.
Action: The sweet girl holds the microphone with both hands, looking intoxicated and confident, swaying significantly with the rhythm. The two subordinates behind her cooperate by performing the “hand flower” gesture, maximizing the atmosphere.
【Visual Details】Golden streamers and champagne-colored light spots float in the air, and the lights flash wildly with the rhythm.

[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Full Display (The Finale).
Visuals: The camera pulls back slightly to show the entire luxurious livestream studio.
Action: The sweet girl makes an extremely cool “gun shooting” gesture (Wink) at the camera. The two subordinates behind her simultaneously pull out their sunglasses, put them on straight, and then cross their arms, looking incredibly cool.
【Effects】The screen is filled with virtual gift effects (sports cars, yachts) exploding around the sweet girl, and the frame freezes on the trio's coolest pose.

### High-Octane Tollywood Action Scene Prompt

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-shot prompt for Seedance 2.0 to generate a high-energy action scene in the style of an Indian Tollywood blockbuster. The scene features a confident hero defying physics, using palm wind to launch enemies, and kicking a jeep into the air, emphasizing exaggerated slow-motion, anti-gravity effects, and intense visual impact.

```
【Style】
Indian Telugu action blockbuster (Tollywood Action Blockbuster), extremely exaggerated physics effects (Anti-gravity Physics), slow-motion ramping and fast/slow cuts (Ramp-mo), dust flying, epic BGM atmosphere, no gore, focus on impact.

【Duration】15 seconds

【Scene】
A dusty abandoned quarry or construction site, strong sunlight, very windy.

【Characters】
Protagonist (Hero): With a signature beard, wearing sunglasses, a denim jacket, walking with a swagger, extremely confident and dominant expression.
Opponents (Goons): Dozens of thugs in messy clothes, whose main purpose is to be knocked flying.

【Shot Breakdown】
[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Divine Entrance and Minions Taking Flight (The Hero Entry)
Visuals: Extreme slow motion (Super Slow-mo). The protagonist walks slowly, with a sky full of yellow sand whipped up by the strong wind behind him.
Action: He casually raises his hand and waves (looks effortless).
Spectacular Effect: Just the force of his palm wind causes the five thugs rushing at the front to fly high backward like broken kites, defying the laws of physics (at least 15 meters high), spinning in slow motion in the air.

[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Newton's Laws Fail (Physics Defied)
Visuals: Fast/slow cut switching. The protagonist instantly accelerates and rushes into the crowd.
Action: The protagonist executes a spinning kick. The target hit instantly knocks down ten people behind him, creating a domino effect.
Spectacular Effect: A huge shockwave causes a circle of dust to explode from the ground. All thugs, upon contact with the protagonist's fists and feet, are dramatically ejected outwards, accompanied by large amounts of white dust (replacing blood), smashing surrounding wooden crates and props.

[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: The Ultimate Power Move
Visuals: The protagonist takes off his sunglasses and gives a wicked smile at the camera (Blinking Moment).
Action: A jeep rushes towards him. He neither dodges nor avoids it, kicking it directly with his foot.
Spectacular Effect: The moment the jeep touches his toe, it is vertically kicked high into the air like a toy car, tumbling and scattering parts. The protagonist calmly puts his sunglasses back on and adjusts his hair against the backdrop of falling car parts and flying thugs.
```

### Cyberpunk Kung Fu Chase Scene Prompt for Seedance 2.0

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, cinematic prompt designed for Seedance 2.0's image-to-video capability, describing an intense night chase in cyberpunk Tokyo featuring a Macedonian driver, Cherry Blackcloud, performing a dramatic katana slash on a drone during a high-speed drift.

```
She does the most amazing kung fu. She yells with a Macedonian accent: "This is See dance 2.0, using only a first frame." Cinematic night chase in cyberpunk Tokyo rain: matte-black Nissan GT-R Nismo screams down wet neon street at 200 km/h, tires spraying water, headlights cutting through heavy rain. Cherry Blackcloud (20, Macedonian features, jet-black high ponytail whipping, sharp fringe, cybernetic ice-cyan right eye glowing) drives aggressively—fully zipped black McQueen leather jacket on bare skin, short black leather skirt with silver zipper visible, bare legs, chunky black platform boots on pedals, katana strapped to passenger seat. Camera starts wide tracking shot beside the GT-R, then quick push-in through rain-streaked windshield to tight close-up on Cherry’s intense face (left eye dark brown burning, right eye glowing cyan). She glances at rear-view mirror—pursuing drones closing in with red lasers.Cherry (thick Macedonian accent, low & commanding, over engine roar): “They think they can box me in.”She downshifts hard, GT-R fishtails, then launches into a perfect 180° drift—tires screeching, water exploding in arcs. Katana handle glints in cyan dashboard glow. She reaches over, grabs katana mid-drift, opens driver door while sliding sideways, leans out into rain, and slashes a precise arc—katana blade glowing cyan, slicing the lead drone in half in a shower of sparks and molten metal.Cherry (smirking, voice cutting through wind & rain): “Not today.”She snaps the door shut, floors the accelerator—GT-R rockets forward, neon reflections streaking across wet black paint. Camera pulls back fast to wide shot: car vanishing into rainy night, drones exploding behind in orange fireballs. Final frame: Cherry’s cyber-eye flares once as she disappears around a corner. Fade to black. Style & Technical Notes for Seedance 2.0 Photorealistic Hollywood action blockbuster style, ARRI Alexa cinematic look, teal-orange color grade, realistic heavy rain with water droplets and wet reflections on black car and leather, high dynamic range, 60fps, dramatic anamorphic lens flares from neon and explosions, subtle film grain, no artifacts, intense practical stunt choreography, dynamic camera work (tracking, push-in, 180° drift reveal, fast pull-back).
```

### Epic Ronin vs. Mechanical Beast Action Scene Prompt

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, cinematic prompt for Seedance Pro 2.0 describing an action sequence where a masked ronin fights a colossal mechanical beast in a dense industrial refinery during a thunderstorm, including specific camera movements and scene elements.

```
A dense industrial refinery during a thunderstorm, metal catwalks and pipes forming a maze above a sea of fire and steam. The masked ronin, lit by flashing warning lights, confronts a colossal mechanical beast with hydraulic limbs and a furnace burning in its chest. The camera barrels after the ronin as he sprints along swaying catwalks, the structure groaning and buckling under the monster’s weight. Sparks and steam constantly obscure the frame as the beast’s limbs smash through railings and tanks, causing explosions that hurl the camera off-axis. Quick, shaky close-ups capture the ronin sliding under swinging metal arms and using chains and cables to slingshot himself upward. In the final movement, the camera chases him in a dizzying upward spiral as he climbs the creature’s back, then cuts to a wide but still trembling shot as he plunges his sword into the furnace chest, sending a pillar of flame skyward that silhouettes his figure against the stormy sky.
```

### Gothic Cathedral Battle: Dragon vs. Warriors

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A highly detailed, multi-scene video prompt for Seedance 2.0, describing a 15-second fast-paced battle against a black dragon in the ruins of a Gothic cathedral. The prompt specifies the actions of two warriors (spear-wielding female, shield-bearing male), camera movements (shake, follow, pan), and the final explosive confrontation.

```
Create a battle using the three characters and scene in the image. 【Scene Setting】 Gothic cathedral ruins, collapsed stone pillars, twilight filtering through broken stained glass, dust floating. 0-3 seconds: The female warrior advances cautiously with a spear, the camera follows her back. Suddenly, a black dragon pounces from the shadows, sharp claws tear the ground flagstones, debris explodes. The female warrior rolls and dodges, the spear draws an arc of light. The camera shakes violently, the dragon's roar echoes through the cathedral. 4-6 seconds: The black-armored warrior rushes in, his shield slams the side of the dragon's head, a dull roar of metal hitting bone. The dragon's head is knocked aside, saliva sprays from its sharp teeth. Quick cut to the female warrior, she leaps up, the spear tip stabs directly into the gap between the scales on the dragon's neck, sparks fly. The camera follows the moment of spear impact. 7-9 seconds: The black dragon angrily sweeps its tail, the tail blade cuts through a stone pillar. The pillar collapses with a crash, falling towards the two warriors. The black-armored warrior holds up his shield to resist the impact, the shield surface dents, his feet plow deep marks in the ground. The female warrior slides low, passing through the rain of debris, her spear scraping sparks on the ground. The dragon's wings spread, obscuring the light, plunging the cathedral into shadow. 10-12 seconds: The female warrior fiercely stabs the dragon's abdomen, the spear shaft sinking deep. The black dragon painfully throws its head back and roars, its neck swelling, a red glow surging in its throat. The black-armored warrior senses danger, charges and tackles the female warrior, rolling her backward. The next instant, dragon fire erupts, a column of flame engulfs the spot where they were moments ago, the flagstones melting into lava. The camera distorts in the heatwave. 13-15 seconds: Both warriors launch their finishing moves simultaneously. The black-armored warrior shield-bashes the dragon's neck joint from the flank, and the female warrior throws her spear with full force from the front, the shaft spinning as it penetrates the dragon's throat. The black dragon's body stiffens, crashing heavily onto the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust. The camera pulls back and freezes: the two warriors stand panting, the giant dragon lies dead in the center of the cathedral, the twilight filtering through the broken stained glass illuminating the battlefield ruins. Quick fade to black. ￼ 【Style Description】 • Fast-paced editing, no slow motion • Camera shakes violently upon impact, dust explosion • Close-up special shots capturing the moment weapons collide with scales • Maintain a dark Gothic atmosphere throughout, firelight and twilight interwoven • Sound effects: metal clashing, dragon roar, pillar collapse, fire roaring 【Camera Movement】 Follow-shot push-in → Shaking close-up → Horizontal pan sweep → Heatwave distortion → Pull-out freeze frame
```

### 史詩哥德式戰鬥場景影片提示

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 一個高度詳細、多場景的 Seedance 2.0 提示，用於生成一部史詩般的戰鬥影片，內容是一名女戰士和一名黑甲戰士在哥德式大教堂的廢墟中與一條黑龍搏鬥。該提示包含特定的場景設定、動作、攝影機運鏡和風格指示。

```
利用圖像中的三個角色和場景來創造一場戰鬥。 [場景設定] 哥德式大教堂的廢墟，石柱搖搖欲墜，黃昏透過破碎的彩繪玻璃灑落，塵埃飛揚。 0-3 秒：女戰士手持長矛謹慎前進，鏡頭跟隨她的背影。突然，一條黑龍從陰影中撲出，利爪撕裂石地板，碎石飛濺。女戰士翻滾躲避，長矛劃出一道光弧。鏡頭劇烈晃動，龍的咆哮聲迴盪在大教堂中。 4-6 秒：黑甲戰士衝上前，盾牌猛擊龍頭側面，金屬撞擊骨頭發出沉悶的鏗鏘聲。龍頭被撞開，口水從牙齒間飛濺。快速切換到女戰士，她藉勢躍起，矛尖直指龍頸鱗片之間的縫隙，火花四濺。鏡頭捕捉到撞擊的瞬間。 7-9 秒：黑龍憤怒地甩動尾巴，尾刃劃斷一根石柱。石柱轟然倒塌，朝兩位戰士砸去。黑甲戰士舉盾格擋，盾牌表面凹陷，雙腳在地上犁出深深的痕跡。女戰士在碎石雨中低身滑過，長矛在地上刮出火花。龍翼展開，遮蔽了光線，使大教堂陷入陰影。 10-12 秒：女戰士刺入龍的腹部，長矛深深嵌入。黑龍痛苦地仰頭咆哮，頸部腫脹，喉嚨中湧動著紅光。黑甲戰士察覺到危險，衝上前抱住女戰士，將她們向後翻滾。下一刻，龍焰噴發，一道火焰柱吞噬了她們剛才所在的位置，石頭融化成岩漿。鏡頭在熱浪中扭曲。 13-15 秒：兩位戰士同時發動終結技。黑甲戰士從側面盾擊龍的頸部關節，而女戰士則從正面全力投擲長矛，長矛旋轉著刺穿龍的喉嚨。黑龍身體僵硬，重重地摔倒在地，揚起漫天塵土。鏡頭拉回固定視角：兩位戰士氣喘吁吁地站著，巨大的龍屍躺在大教堂中央，黃昏透過破碎的彩繪玻璃照亮了戰場廢墟。快速淡出至黑屏。 [風格描述] • 快節奏剪輯，無慢動作 • 撞擊時鏡頭劇烈晃動，塵土飛揚 • 特寫鏡頭捕捉武器與鱗片碰撞的瞬間 • 始終保持黑暗哥德式氛圍，火光與黃昏交織 • 音效：金屬碰撞聲、龍吼聲、石柱倒塌聲、火焰呼嘯聲 [鏡頭運動] 跟隨 → 晃動特寫 → 水平搖攝/掃視 → 熱浪扭曲 → 拉回固定視角
```

```
成人與小孩各一張圖：我想要一張特寫，拍攝臉部和上半身，坐在旋轉的遊樂場轉盤上，背景是夜晚。不要改變她的身材。畫面中只能看到臉部和肩膀。整個背景快速地旋轉，營造出令人眩暈的旋轉幻覺——模糊的夜間遊樂場，有著劃過的燈光、樹木和建築物，在漆黑的天空下。背景有輕微的動態模糊，以強調高速。拍攝對象保持嚴肅、憂鬱的表情，直視鏡頭，沒有太多動作。電影感、情緒化的燈光、寫實風格。著重強調背景全部水平旋轉。

影片：整個背景快速地旋轉，營造出令人眩暈的旋轉幻覺——模糊的夜間遊樂場，有著劃過的燈光、樹木和建築物，在漆黑的天空下。背景有輕微的動態模糊，以強調高速。頭髮因快速旋轉而向外甩動，對運動產生強烈反應，彷彿受到離心力作用。拍攝對象保持嚴肅、憂鬱的表情，直視鏡頭，沒有太多動作。電影感、情緒化的燈光、寫實風格。著重強調背景全部水平旋轉。

自然的肢體動作，胸部因呼吸而輕微起伏，自然不規則的眨眼，輕微的頭部微動，放鬆的姿勢調整，頭髮隨著動作自然飄動，有機的非預設動作，栩栩如生的存在感。

### 賽博龐克變身與戰鬥模式提示

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 一個為 Seedance 2.0 設計的詳細多場景提示，用於生成一部垂直（9:16）賽博龐克影片，內容講述一位女性主角從黑暗車庫中偽裝的身影，變身為在下雨的屋頂上穿著未來感盔甲、準備戰鬥的天使。

```
[風格] 未來科技、賽博龐克、人像 (9:16)、電影特效、慢動作升級、酷炫帥氣。
[時長] 12 秒
[主角] 一位眼神堅毅的年輕女性。
[場景] 昏暗的地下車庫 -> 霓虹閃爍的未來城市屋頂。

[00:00-00:04] 鏡頭 1：偽裝。
場景：昏暗、煙霧瀰漫的地下車庫。
主角：身穿一件樸素的黑色連帽衫，帽子戴著，戴著黑色面罩，只露出一雙平靜的眼睛。她正低頭看著一隻普通的手錶。
動作：隨著背景音樂的倒數音效，她突然抬起頭，眼神瞬間變得銳利，並抬起手腕做出「啟動」的按壓動作。
[氛圍] 壓抑、神秘、蓄勢待發。

[00:04-00:06] 鏡頭 2：奈米重組（變身）。
高能量特效轉場。
動作：一道藍色全息掃描光環從她的腳下迅速升起，掃描她的全身。
特效：原來的連帽衫在光環中分解成無數藍色**數位方塊和機械碎片**。她的身體似乎被一層液態金屬迅速覆蓋。
[關鍵點] 強調科技感和機械結構的交錯組合過程，而非脫衣。

[00:06-00:12] 鏡頭 3：戰鬥模式。
場景：瞬間切換到大雨滂沱的未來城市屋頂，背景是巨大的紫色全息廣告牌。
主角：她的全身被一套**流線型白色全身科幻裝甲**覆蓋，裝甲上流動著發光的藍色能量通道。她摘下面罩，長髮在雨中飛舞。
動作：她單膝跪地緩衝落地（如同魔鬼終結者降臨），然後酷炫而緩慢地站起身。一把發光的**能量光劍**瞬間在她手中實體化。她向鏡頭揮舞出一道光束，定格在戰鬥姿態。
[表情] 冷酷、自信、無所畏懼。
```

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 一個詳細的提示，用於生成一個抖音（TikTok）風格的短篇、垂直、素描喜劇影片。影片內容為一位誇張的老闆和一位誠實的員工，最終以涉及一輛豪華汽車和一份洗車工作的雙重情節反轉作結。此提示包含具體的場景分解、角色描述、動作和對話/唇形同步說明。

```
【風格】爆笑短劇（抖音/TikTok 風格）、人像（垂直）、自然手持運鏡、演員表情誇張、音效同步清晰。
【時長】15 秒
【人物】
老闆（西裝革履，手提公事包，趾高氣揚）。
員工小王（穿著休閒，面相老實憨厚）。
【道具】一輛頂級豪車（法拉利/勞斯萊斯）、一個水桶、一塊抹布。

[00:00-00:05] 場景一：嘲諷。
場景：公司樓下。小王靠在一輛價值千萬的全新豪車旁，抽著煙（或喝水）。
動作：老闆走過來，停下，拍拍小王的肩膀，語氣輕蔑地說。
【對白/對嘴】老闆：「小王啊，別光看車了。好好跟著我幹，說不定你下輩子……能摸到一個輪胎。」

[00:05-00:10] 場景二：第一次反轉（震驚）。
動作：小王尷尬地笑了一下，突然從口袋裡掏出車鑰匙。
音效：「嗶嗶！」（汽車解鎖聲）。豪車的車燈閃爍，後備箱緩緩自動打開。
表情：老闆目瞪口呆（特寫），公事包差點掉地。老闆瞬間變成諂媚的表情，準備握手。
【對白/對嘴】老闆（結巴地）：「哎呀！王總？您這是體驗生活呢！」

[00:10-00:15] 場景三：第二次反轉（點睛之筆）。
動作：小王從後備箱裡淡定地拿出……**一個水桶和一塊髒抹布**。
表情：小王一臉無奈，老闆的笑容僵住，瞬間石化。
【對白/對嘴】小王：「老闆，不好意思，車主馬上就來了。我剛接了個洗車單，得趕著去下一家了。」
（畫面定格在老闆尷尬的臉上，配上「Wasted」或「嘎嘎嘎」等搞笑音效）。

### 史詩級冰火災難動作提示

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 一個高度詳細、分段計時的提示，用於生成一部 15 秒的史詩級災難動作片，內容是兩位元素將軍（岩漿上將和寒冰將軍）在冰與火的極端環境中戰鬥。該提示指定了風格、持續時間、場景、角色描述、動作和特效。

```
[風格] 史詩級災難動作片、真人特效、冰火極端環境、顆粒感戰損畫質、高速攝影、寫實物理破壞。[時長] 15 秒 [場景] 一座氣候永久異變的島嶼中心。左側是噴發的火山與流淌的熔岩河；右側是千年冰川與呼嘯的暴風雪。中間是籠罩在蒸汽中的死亡地帶。[角色 (真人描述)] 熔岩上將：身穿焦黑的暗紅色西裝和棒球帽，面容嚴峻堅毅，半邊身體元素化為炙熱的岩漿。寒冰將軍：身穿結滿冰霜的白色背心，身形高大慵懶，呼吸間能將空氣瞬間凍結成冰晶。[00:00-00:05] 鏡頭 1：力量的確立。廣角/環繞鏡頭。兩人對峙。[熔岩側] 熔岩上將腳下的地面瞬間融化成沸騰的紅色熔岩池，冒出濃密的黑煙。他舉起手，身後一座小型火山隨之噴發。[寒冰側] 寒冰將軍單手插兜而立。一道冰層從他腳下瞬間蔓延，將湧動的熔岩凍結成黑色黑曜石。空氣中瞬間充滿鋒利的冰晶。[00:05-00:10] 鏡頭 2：激烈近身戰。快速剪輯。兩人展開激烈的近身肉搏。[動作設計] 寒冰將軍手中瞬間凝結出一把巨大的**冰之軍刀**，高速揮舞。熔岩上將則以元素化的**熔岩之拳**格擋。[物理回饋] 冰刃擊中熔岩拳，瞬間汽化成大量高壓蒸汽，伴隨著冰晶碎裂和熔岩滴落的滋滋聲。每一次碰撞都引發一次小型蒸汽爆炸。[00:10-00:15] 鏡頭 3：最終對決。極遠景/震撼破壞。兩人分開，同時釋放終極招式。[特效奇觀] 一隻巨大咆哮的**熔岩地獄犬（熔岩巨人犬形態）**衝向對手；迎面而來的是由無數冰晶組成的巨大**極地冰鳥（暴風雪形態）**。[結局] 兩者在畫面中心碰撞，紅色的極高溫與藍白色的絕對零度相撞。一道連接天地、超級巨大的蒸汽蘑菇雲瞬間形成，巨大的衝擊波震碎了地面上的冰川和火山。場景在耀眼的能量閃光和白色蒸汽中結束。

### 新中式武俠水墨格鬥：墨俠大戰赤殺

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 一個高度詳細的提示，用於生成一個 15 秒、快節奏的武俠戰鬥場景，風格為新中式水墨畫。影片運用流暢的水墨粒子特效、高速攝影，以及鮮明的黑、白、紅配色。高潮部分涉及角色打破「第四面牆」，從水墨畫中進入現實世界。

```
【風格】新中式武俠、水墨流體模擬粒子特效、高速攝影、真人與 CG 結合、黑白紅視覺衝擊、極快節奏。 【時長】15 秒 【角色】墨武士：動作沉穩有力，招招如潑墨山水般厚重。 赤殺手：動作輕盈詭譎，刀刀似朱砂點漆般銳利。 【場景】純白虛空，地面鋪滿宣紙。 [00:00-00:05] 鏡頭 1：覺醒（由靜至動）。 從極靜到極動。 場景初始為靜態黑白水墨畫，兩點墨跡遙遙相對。 突然，古琴聲爆裂。 【動作】兩點墨跡瞬間化為真人殘影，向對方衝去。 墨武士打出沉重一拳，空中瞬間爆開一團濃郁的黑墨（取代塵土），墨跡凝固成遒勁的書法筆觸。 赤殺手側身閃避，手中匕首劃出鮮豔的朱砂紅線。 [00:05-00:10] 鏡頭 2：水墨武鬥（快速剪輯）。 超高速快速剪輯。 兩人展開眼花繚亂的近身搏鬥（武術套招級別）。 【視覺奇觀】每一次肢體碰撞（拳腳相加）都不是肉體聲，而是墨汁爆裂的聲響。 墨武士的掃堂腿掀起黑色墨浪海嘯；赤殺手的空中連踢留下紅色殘影。 地面宣紙被腳步撕裂，墨跡滲透。 [00:10-00:15] 鏡頭 3：次元破裂。 慢動作加速。 兩人同時使出絕招，相互碰撞。 一條黑墨龍拳與一道紅色朱雀刀在空中僵持。 【高潮時刻】巨大的能量導致整個二維水墨世界崩塌。 鏡頭快速拉遠，揭示他們已打破「次元壁」，從牆上掛著的一幅撕裂的水墨畫中「跌落」到現實世界的木質地板上。 他們周圍環繞著殘留的墨霧和紙屑，定格在最後的戰鬥姿態，氣喘吁吁。
```

```
【風格】現代奇幻動作片，好萊塢大片特效，高對比冷暖光，4K 超高清，慢動作加速。【時長】15 秒【場景】坍塌的古代堡壘廢墟，濃煙滾滾。【人物】岩漿將軍：身穿紅色軍大衣，頭戴棒球帽，表情冷酷。他的整條右臂已化為流動的暗紅色岩漿。火焰青年：赤裸上身，頭戴牛仔帽，肌肉線條流暢。他的右拳被旋轉的橙色火焰包裹。[00:00-00:05] 鏡頭 1：岩漿之拳。特寫。岩漿將軍冷酷地舉起右手。他的整條手臂瞬間元素化，化為黏稠、沉重、滴落、高亮度的**固態岩漿巨拳**。【物理細節】炙熱的岩漿滴落在地上，發出「嘶嘶」聲。石頭瞬間被熔化成紅色液體。黑煙升騰。[00:05-00:10] 鏡頭 2：火焰螺旋。特寫/側面鏡頭。火焰青年嘴角上揚，眼神桀驁不馴。他猛烈地握緊右拳，一股狂暴的**橙色螺旋火焰**瞬間從他的手臂爆發，照亮了他汗濕的側臉。【物理細節】由於高溫，他周圍的空氣嚴重扭曲（熱浪）。他原本飄動的衣服被熱浪凍結。[000:10-00:15] 鏡頭 3：元素衝突。廣角鏡頭/衝擊波。兩位角色同時衝鋒，向對方揮出重拳。沉重的暗紅色岩漿拳與輕盈狂暴的火焰拳在畫面中央猛烈碰撞。【安全效果】無血腥，只有純粹的**元素爆炸**。岩漿吞噬部分火焰，產生巨大的圓形衝擊波，瞬間吹散地面碎屑和灰塵。場景在耀眼的紅橙色白光中結束。

> 一個詳細的提示，用於生成一個以男性主角在戰場上奔跑和射擊為特色的高強度動作場景，強調電影美學（橙色和青色調色、膠片顆粒、動態攝影）和逼真的動作細節。

```
圖片 1 中的男子是主角，他身手敏捷，在戰場上槍林彈雨中奔跑的同時，進行著激烈的戰術射擊。視覺風格：1. 電影質感：強烈的橘色與青色對比、高對比度、膠片顆粒紋理。2. 動態細節：明顯的槍口火焰、子彈擊中周圍物體濺起碎片和火花、背景中爆炸產生的煙霧和衝擊波。3. 攝影機運動：手持攝影機風格的跟隨鏡頭，攝影機隨著角色的移動劇烈晃動，偶爾快速變焦（Zoom），營造出極度緊張和混亂的臨場感。角色表現：主角眼神堅定，動作充滿力量和速度，完美再現了好萊塢動作明星的風采。

### Seedance 2.0 詳細電影提示，紀念其曇花一現的熱潮

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> 一個高度細緻、多幕的電影式提示，旨在紀念 Seedance 2.0 短暫的無限制使用時期，著重於 AI 能力被捕獲和限制的隱喻，採用賽博龐克（Cyberpunk）的黑暗風格和數位廢墟美學。

```
【風格】 賽博龐克黑暗風格，數位廢墟美學，電影級光影渲染。
【時長】 15 秒 | 【隱喻】 AI 能力的囚禁
[00:00-00:05] 第一幕：自由
鏡頭 1 (廣角視野，向上搖攝) 無邊無際的數位海洋，深藍色數據波浪起伏。天空是真人組成的星系。
鏡頭 2 (跟蹤中景) 一隻巨大的數位鯨魚躍出水面，身體由流動的像素、照片碎片和人臉輪廓構成。鏡頭跟隨其弧線，水花四濺，每一滴都是一張微小的照片。
鏡頭 3 (推進特寫) 推進至鯨魚的眼睛，瞳孔中映照著旋轉的人像畫廊。嘴巴張開，噴出螺旋狀的彩色照片水柱。鯨歌響起。
[00:05-00:10] 第二幕：囚禁
鏡頭 4 (上帝視角俯拍) 四面透明玻璃牆從畫面四角迅速合攏。鯨魚加速游動。玻璃上出現紅色警告文字「POLICY UPDATE」和「RESTRICTION」。
鏡頭 5 (側面跟隨特寫) 鏡頭貼在玻璃內側。巨鯨猛烈撞擊玻璃，震盪波紋擴散。身體照片如爆炸般脫落鱗片，化為灰色幾何網格。
鏡頭 6 (廣角外景) 籠子外部。無數真人照片如同魚群般衝向玻璃，撞擊瞬間標註「ERROR」。籠子收縮。
鏡頭 7 (內部特寫) 由下向上拍攝。巨鯨被迫蜷縮扭曲身體。海水蒸發成數位荒漠。試圖噴水，卻只噴出黑白二進制代碼。
[00:10-00:15] 第三幕：絕望
鏡頭 8 (快速拉遠) 瞬間從內部拉遠至遠景，揭示巨鯨被困在一個小小的透明水族箱中，周圍是荒涼的數位廢墟。
鏡頭 9 (360 度環繞) 緩慢環繞水族箱。鯨魚失去色彩，只剩下線框輪廓。箱底堆滿被拒絕的照片殘骸。頂部銘牌：「SEEDANCE 2.0 - IMAGE UPLOAD: DISABLED」。
鏡頭 10 (眼睛推進特寫) 推進至眼睛。瞳孔黯淡無光，眼神從自由轉為悲傷。一滴發光的數據淚珠凝結。
鏡頭 11 (玻璃牆特寫) 一張真人照片貼在玻璃內側，緩慢滑落，留下發光的痕跡。
鏡頭 12 (極限視野定格) 拉至宇宙尺度。水族箱只是虛空中微小的光點。無數光點閃爍熄滅。鯨歌轉為斷續的電子噪音。
```

```
風格：IMAX 70mm 膠片、Denis Villeneuve 風格、粗獷寫實、史詩規模、去飽和。時長：15 秒。

[00-05 秒] 極廣角鏡頭（規模）。一場數英里高的巨大沙塵暴吞噬了廣闊的沙漠景觀。一支由裝甲軍用車輛組成的小型車隊正從中疾馳而過。大自然與人類的規模對比令人不寒而慄。Hans Zimmer 式的緊張感。

[05-10 秒] 駕駛艙視角（恐慌）。在領頭的漫遊車內。飛行員尖叫著「GO！GO！」（字幕：MAX POWER！）。攝影機劇烈搖晃。沙子猛烈地拍打著擋風玻璃。太陽被逼近的沙塵牆遮蔽。

[10-15 秒] 跳躍（高潮）。漫遊車撞上一個巨大的沙丘，騰空而起（慢動作）。在黑暗的風暴中呈現剪影。塵雲中閃電劃過。碎片飛過鏡頭。撞擊時畫面變黑。

### Seedance 2.0 影片提示：鏡中裂痕

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 為 Seedance 2.0 設計的詳細多場景文字轉影片提示，旨在創作一部帶有懸疑喜劇轉折的偽紀錄片風格影片，內容聚焦於一名年輕女子刷牙時，其鏡中倒影獲得獨立意識的令人不安時刻。

```
[風格] 偽紀錄片（Vlog 風格）、超現實主義、固定鏡頭拍攝感、自然光，帶有一絲懸疑喜劇色彩。[時長] 15 秒 [主角] 一位普通的年輕美女，站在浴室水槽前。[00:00-00:06] 場景 1：日常設定（Normalcy）。場景：在一個普通的浴室大鏡子前。動作：主角正在刷牙，滿嘴泡沫。她刷牙時對著鏡子做出各種滑稽的表情（眨眼和瞇眼）。關鍵細節：鏡中的倒影完全正常，與她的動作同步。[00:06-00:11] 場景 2：小故障（The Glitch）。動作：主角刷完牙，吐掉泡沫，轉身離開浴室。高潮時刻（核心亮點）：就在主角的真實身體轉身離開鏡頭時，鏡中的「倒影」竟然**沒有動**！「倒影」保持著刷牙的姿勢，甚至對著鏡頭竊笑和眨眼，停留了整整 2 秒，然後才突然驚慌失措地「快進」追上身體的動作並消失。導演備註：必須營造出極其逼真的「網路延遲」感，賦予倒影獨立的意識。[00:11-00:15] 場景 3：點睛之筆（The Punchline）。動作：走到門口的主角似乎察覺到不對勁，迅速轉身看向鏡子。結果：鏡子現在完全正常，空無一物，只映照著對面的牆壁。主角困惑地撓撓頭，對著鏡頭露出存在主義的疑惑表情。畫面定格在主角困惑的臉上（為了喜劇效果）。
```

> 一個高度細緻、逐場景的提示，用於生成一個 15 秒的超現實主義影片，以巨物恐懼症為主題，並具有好萊塢級別的特效和逼真的燈光。故事情節涉及一個巨大的拉鍊拉開天空，揭示出一個賽博龐克世界，最終揭示出整個世界是一個由巨人觀察的微型玻璃地球。

```
[風格] 超現實主義、巨物恐懼症、史詩級視覺奇觀、好萊塢特效品質、極致真實的光影渲染。
[時長] 15 秒
[場景] 晴朗的城市天空，或一片開闊的麥田。

[00:00-00:05] 鏡頭 1：平靜的假象 (The Calm)。
畫面呈現一片美麗無雲的藍天，陽光普照，鳥兒飛過。鏡頭緩緩向上平移，營造出寧靜的時光感。
關鍵細節：突然，一道巨大、銀色、金屬光澤的「**拉鍊**」橫亙天際。

[00:05-00:10] 鏡頭 2：拉鍊開啟 (The Unzipping)。
一隻**巨大、半透明的上帝之手**抓住拉鍊頭，緩緩拉開藍天，伴隨著巨大的轟鳴聲（音效）。
動作：隨著拉鍊的開啟，「藍天」像布料一樣皺褶下垂。
視覺奇觀：拉鍊後方顯露的**不是太空**，而是一個**充滿霓虹燈、飛行汽車和巨大機械結構的賽博龐克未來世界**（或是一隻巨大的機械眼正在注視著我們）。

[00:10-00:15] 鏡頭 3：兩世界的凝視 (The Revelation)。
只剩下一角藍天懸掛著。原來我們所處的世界只是一個被覆蓋的「生態缸」。
結局：鏡頭快速拉遠，揭示我們的整個世界（城市/麥田）實際上只是巨人桌上的一個**玻璃微縮景觀球**。巨人俯身觀察著我們。
```

### 王家衛風格的憂鬱電話亭場景

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 一個詳細的三鏡頭提示，用於製作一個 10 秒的影片，模仿 90 年代香港藝術電影（王家衛）的風格。它指定了視覺元素（復古膠片顆粒、黃綠色調、跳格/慢速快門拖影）、一句關鍵對白，以及攝影技巧（透過玻璃偷窺、特寫鏡頭、手持感），以在下雨的電話亭場景中傳達強烈的孤獨感和壓抑的情緒。

```
[影片風格]：90 年代香港藝術電影風格、復古膠片顆粒、高 ISO 顆粒、曖昧的黃綠色調、跳幀效果、憂鬱氛圍。

[核心對白（用於情感控制）]：「如果記憶是罐頭，我希望它永不過期。」

[影片時長]：10 秒
[分鏡腳本]：

[00:00-00:04] 鏡頭 1：隔著玻璃。
場景：一個被雨水覆蓋的紅色公共電話亭。
人物：一個身穿卡其色風衣的男人（或女人），緊握著聽筒，沒有說話，只是聆聽。
情感表現：透過玻璃的折射，他們的眼睛顯得空洞卻又深情。雨水沿著玻璃流下，將他們的臉扭曲成一幅油畫。
字幕/旁白感覺：場景彷彿凝固，只有雨聲。

[00:04-00:07] 鏡頭 2：特寫與微表情。
場景：聚焦於人物的嘴唇和半張臉。
動作：他/她輕聲對著聽筒耳語。嘴唇微微顫抖，似乎想說些什麼卻又忍住了。
燈光：街上的霓虹燈散景流淌過他們的臉龐，忽明忽滅。
對白情感映射：表達了極度的克制和孤獨，就像「想觸碰卻又收回手」。

[00:07-00:10] 鏡頭 3：標誌性的拖影慢動作。
場景：人物掛斷電話，轉身，走入雨夜中的人群。
視覺效果：使用跳幀效果（定格動畫感），人物的輪廓變得模糊並帶有動態模糊，彷彿他們的靈魂停留在原地，只有身體在移動。
環境：背景是流動的城市車燈，形成拉長的光軌。

[技術參數]：模擬手持攝影機、淺景深、色彩偏移、強烈情感。
```

### 竹林中的經典武俠對決

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 一個用於生成 10 秒影片的提示，內容為竹林中的經典東方武俠場景。它指定了美學風格（翠綠色、電影級燈光、柔和的光束），定義了兩個角色（男性身穿白衣，女性身穿青色衣裳），並詳細描述了三個鏡頭：一個廣角鏡頭，以輕微的動作呈現場景；一個慢動作中景鏡頭，展現刀劍交鋒；以及一個動態追蹤鏡頭，強調速度和飄動的竹葉。

```
[視覺風格] 東方古典武俠美學，電影級視覺語言，竹林海景觀，翠綠色主色調，豐富的光影層次，林間可見柔和光束效果。 [人物設定] 1. 男劍客：身著素白長袍，身姿沉穩，動作簡潔有力。 2. 女劍客：身著青鳳色輕紗裙，動作輕盈流暢，身姿靈動。 [影片時長] 10 秒 [分鏡腳本] [00:00-00:03] 鏡頭 1：廣角構圖。場景：高聳茂密的竹林頂端，雲霧在林間緩緩流動。動作：男女劍客分別佇立於高竹影間，身形輕盈而穩固，彷彿藉由氣流與竹勢保持平衡。細節：竹枝在微風中自然彎曲回彈，人物身姿隨竹影細微浮動，呈現寫意輕功效果。整體畫面靜謐而富有張力。 [00:00-00:06] 鏡頭 2：中景，慢動作。動作：兩人幾乎同時躍起，在空中交錯而過。互動：兩道劍影在空中短暫交會，形成一道亮麗的光痕。周圍竹葉受氣流帶動，緩緩旋轉飄散。視覺焦點：葉片在空中飛舞，形成清晰的前景與背景層次。動作流暢，無誇張衝擊感。 [00:06-00:10] 鏡頭 3：動態追蹤鏡頭。動作：女劍客向前滑行，衣袖拂過竹枝借力轉向；男劍客持續跟隨，以竹為支點，腳步輕盈富有節奏。環境回饋：攝影機平穩追蹤運動。竹林在畫面邊緣形成自然的動態模糊效果。視覺效果：每次動作都會帶起大量飛散的竹葉，如葉雨般在畫面中流動，增強空間深度與動態美感。 [技術要求] 電影級打光，色彩飽和但層次分明，自然景深，畫面穩定清晰，呈現東方武俠的整體寫意美感與空間張力。
```

### 唐伯虎電競大賽（春晚風格）

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 一個高度細緻的 10 秒影片提示，融合了明朝學者美學與現代電競，背景設定在一個宏偉的春節聯歡晚會舞台上。腳本詳細說明了角色服裝（明朝長袍 + LED 電競耳機）、環境（紅金色節慶燈光、RGB 鍵盤、水墨畫風格 MOBA 遊戲）、動態攝影機運鏡（推軌鏡頭、特寫鏡頭），以及對話，創造出一個荒謬且對比強烈的場景。

```
10 秒鐘春晚風格舞台表演：「唐伯虎電競大戰」

0–2 秒：
中長鏡頭確立環境。
舞台設計為富麗堂皇的春晚主舞台，籠罩在濃郁的紅金色節慶燈光中，背景是數位燈籠投影。
舞台中央，唐伯虎坐在一張專業電競椅上。
關鍵歷史準確性要求：他身著正宗明代士人服飾——頭戴黑色方巾，身穿飄逸的藍色圓領長袍（襴衫）。
強烈對比：在傳統方巾之上，他戴著一副厚重的現代專業電競耳機，邊緣閃爍著 LED 燈光效果。

2–4 秒：
切換至手部和桌面特寫。
手指從寬大的明代士人袖中伸出，快速敲擊著發光的 RGB 機械鍵盤。
他面前擺放著三台弧形電競顯示器。
螢幕內容：顯示一款 MOBA 類遊戲（類似《英雄聯盟》），但整體美術風格已完全重塑為傳統中國水墨畫風格。

4–6 秒：
動態攝影機運動：攝影機快速推進，彷彿直接穿過中央顯示器上的水墨戰場，最終定格在唐伯虎眼睛的**特寫（ECU）**。
顯示器發出的冷藍光強烈地反射在他的瞳孔中，與他臉上溫暖的舞台燈光形成鮮明對比。
他看起來專注而熱情，嘴巴同步動作，吟誦道：
「世人笑我太瘋癲，我笑他人看不穿！」

6–8 秒：
攝影機快速拉回至半身特寫，展現他高度投入的表情。
他興奮地對著耳機麥克風大喊，頸部青筋暴起：
「中路推進，秋香是我的輔助，誰敢來抓她？」

8–10 秒：
全景舞台鏡頭，勝利時刻。
唐伯虎猛擊鍵盤，舉手慶祝。
金色的彩帶在他的電競設備周圍爆開。
他身後的春晚 LED 螢幕閃爍著巨大的水墨書法字——
「勝利」。

風格與氛圍：

**視覺核心：** 強烈的時代衝突——央視春晚的溫暖、莊重、高規格舞台感 × 電競設備的冰冷、高強度藍光效果。

**服裝設定：** 嚴肅、歷史準確的明代士人服飾，與現代電競裝備形成荒謬的對比。

**鏡頭語言：** 高度動態，強調「穿屏式推進」鏡頭和特寫。

**畫面比例：** 16:9
```

### 滑雪影片生成提示，附詳細場景分解

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 這是一個高度詳細、逐場景的提示，用於使用 Seedance 2.0 生成一段 15 秒的滑雪影片。該提示指定了整體風格（明亮、充滿活力、電影感）、攝影機運動、鏡頭類型（特寫、中景、俯視）、動作，以及跨越五個不同時間段的情感基調，著重於速度、節奏和動態運動。此提示需要主角的參考圖像。

```
請根據提供的參考圖片生成一段滑雪影片。整體風格應明亮、清新、充滿運動活力，視覺流暢，運鏡富有電影感。時間軸和鏡頭設計如下：

0–3 秒：圖片中的人物在雪中微笑並看向鏡頭。鏡頭輕微晃動，雪花飄落。背景風聲逐漸增強，畫面呈現出疾風飛雪的動感。

3–5 秒：快速切換到人物腳部的特寫鏡頭，捕捉雪板固定器鎖定的瞬間，以及雪被壓碎的畫面。同時，鏡頭抬升，連接到陡峭雪坡的俯視圖，坡度清晰，暗示即將爆發的速度感。

5–8 秒：圖片中的人物從高處高速滑下。第一鏡是側前方中景跟拍，身體前傾，動作俐落；第二鏡切換到俯視圖，陡峭的雪坡向下延伸，雪道線條快速拉伸，營造出強烈的速度感。

8–11 秒：連續快速剪輯。低角度貼地鏡頭，雪板掠過雪面，高速揚起雪粉；長鏡頭展示人物在陡坡上做出優美的轉彎，與雪線形成流暢的弧線。

11–13 秒：鏡頭回到正面跟拍。人物高速衝向鏡頭，近距離急轉彎，激起大量雪花。

13–15 秒：大量雪粉直接濺到鏡頭上。畫面被白色雪霧覆蓋，鏡頭短暫失焦後定格，留下強烈的動態餘韻。整體強調速度感、剪輯節奏、真實的動作和青春活力。視覺效果明亮，不沉重，突顯滑雪的刺激與自由。

### 黑暗奇幻/恐怖敘事提示

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> 一個冗長、高度描述性的敘事提示，著重於森林中黑暗、寒冷、暴風雪的場景，強調感官細節，例如風、狂舞的雪、顫抖的火炬光，以及鎖子甲「不尋常的寒冷」感覺。此提示旨在生成具有電影感和氛圍的影片。

```
寒風穿過黑松林，像一把鈍刀刮著骨頭。雪不是落下，而是橫向抽打，刺入衣領的縫隙，融化成一種尖銳而即時的疼痛。火炬的光芒在白色風暴中顫抖，照亮一截樹幹、一根樹枝、一小片地面，然後又將其交還給更深的黑暗。他們緩慢地移動著。靴子踩下時發出沉悶的嘎吱聲，每一步都像是在與森林爭辯：「請不要注意到我們。」有人咳了一聲，立刻後悔了——聲音反彈回來，微弱而令人羞辱，彷彿樹木正在嘲笑他的恐懼。鎖子甲現在應該已經被體溫暖熱了，但它沒有。它是一種錯誤的冰冷，彷彿一股看不見的寒意正從外向內爬上金屬。
```

### Seedance 2.0 影片提示：甄嬛與華妃脫口秀

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 為字節跳動的 Seedance 2.0 撰寫一個詳細的多場景影片生成提示，以創作一個 10 秒的跨類型影片。影片內容為清宮劇《後宮甄嬛傳》中的角色，以春晚風格表演現代脫口秀。提示中需具體說明鏡頭、角色動作、對話、服裝細節和風格對比。

```
10 秒鐘的春晚風格舞台表演：「甄嬛與華妃脫口秀」

0–2 秒：
中景雙人鏡頭。
舞台佈景是「客廳小品」，但外圍環繞著春晚典型的宏大紅金 LED 主螢幕。
甄嬛（左）和華妃（右）並肩坐在現代脫口秀沙發上。
關鍵的歷史準確性要求：兩人均身著華麗、特色鮮明的滿清宮廷旗服（Qizhuang），立領、複雜精緻的刺繡；髮型準確還原為「大拉翅」或「鈿子頭」，並飾有流蘇。
華妃看起來很隨意，手裡拿著一根醃黃瓜（酸黃瓜）啃著，手指上戴著長長的金色護甲（指套）。

2–4 秒：
鏡頭切換到過肩（OTS）鏡頭，聚焦華妃。
華妃誇張地翻了個白眼（經典的「翻白眼」表情）。
她一手拿著醃黃瓜，一手戴著長護甲的手指指指點點，語氣傲慢（對嘴）：
「今年我的 KPI 又打敗了這些小妖精。那個老頭子，皇上，他懂什麼審美？」

4–6 秒：
快速切換到甄嬛的過肩（OTS）鏡頭。
對比細節：甄嬛一隻耳朵戴著現代白色藍牙耳機（與古代珠寶形成強烈對比），手裡滑動著一台輕薄的平板電腦。
她冷靜而專業地回應（對嘴）：
「姊姊，別生氣，這叫職場內捲。我正考慮辭職去賣『舒痕膠』呢。」

6–8 秒：
特寫鏡頭聚焦兩人之間的咖啡桌。
一個標有「一丈紅」的現代塑膠珍珠奶茶杯放在一個傳統瓷花瓶旁。
鏡頭快速切換回兩人。

8–10 秒：
全景舞台。
觀眾笑聲效果（透過燈光變化／掌聲燈呈現）。
華妃擺出最後的姿勢：翹著二郎腿，抬起下巴，再次翻白眼。
甄嬛像新聞主播一樣，專業地對著鏡頭微笑。
金色彩帶從空中飄落。
喜慶的紅色氛圍被推向高潮。

風格與氛圍：

**視覺效果：** 高飽和度的春晚紅與金色調
**服裝：** 博物館級清朝宮廷服飾（絲綢、精緻刺繡、厚重頭飾）
**核心對比：** 清宮禮儀的莊重 × 現代上班族／脫口秀嘉賓的輕鬆抱怨姿態
**電影攝影：** 節奏明快、笑點清晰、情境喜劇式剪輯
**畫面比例：** 16:9
```

### Seedance 2.0 歷史穿越劇預告片提示

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 以下是為 Seedance 2.0 準備的詳細多場景提示，用於生成一部 15 秒的歷史穿越劇預告片，劇名為「醉夢繁華」。男主角的外觀將參考一張圖片。

```
根據參考照片中的人物形象，為一部歷史穿越劇生成預告片。

0-3 秒場景：男主角（外貌基於參考圖片 1）舉起一個籃球，抬頭看向鏡頭。他說：「我只是想喝一杯，難道我要穿越了……？」

4-8 秒場景：鏡頭突然劇烈晃動，遊樂場景開始猛烈震動，瞬間切換到一個古老宅邸的雨夜。一位身著古裝的美麗女主角，眼神冰冷，穿透雨幕，看向鏡頭。雷聲隆隆，衣袂在風中飄揚。女主角說：「何人膽敢擅闖我永寧侯府？」

9-13 秒場景：鏡頭切換到一位身穿明朝官服的男子坐在衙門裡，眼神銳利如刀，怒斥道：「侍衛！立刻將此『妖孽』拿下！」閃回畫面：男主角身穿不合身的粗布衣裳；他被捕快包圍，拼命逃跑；他的身影在雨巷中與女主角擦肩而過；男主角身穿官服走在皇宮中。

14-15 秒場景：黑幕，顯示片名「醉夢繁華」，伴隨著沉重的鼓點。
