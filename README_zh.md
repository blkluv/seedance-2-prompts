### Horror Short Film Script: The Mirror Glitch

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, three-scene script prompt for a pseudo-documentary (Vlog style) short film with a suspenseful, slightly horrific tone. The plot centers on a young woman brushing her teeth, where the reflection in the mirror exhibits a delayed, independent consciousness before glitching and disappearing, leaving the protagonist confused and scared. Requires a reference image of the protagonist.

#### 📝 提示词

```
[Style] Pseudo-documentary (Vlog Style), hyperrealism, fixed camera real-shot feel, natural light, with a touch of suspense and horror. 
[Duration] 15 seconds 
[Protagonist (Remember to upload reference image)] A sexy young woman preparing to wash up and go to bed in front of her bathroom sink. 
[00:00-00:06] Shot 1: Normalcy. Scene: In front of a regular large bathroom mirror. Action: The protagonist is brushing her teeth, mouth full of foam. She makes various funny faces at the mirror while brushing (winking and squinting). Key Detail: The reflection in the mirror is completely normal and synchronized with her actions. 
[00:06-00:11] Shot 2: The Glitch. Action: The protagonist finishes brushing, spits out the foam, and turns to leave the bathroom. High-Energy Moment (Core Plot Point): Just as the protagonist's real body turns and leaves the mirror frame, the “reflection” in the mirror **does not move**! The “reflection” remains in the brushing posture, even smirking and raising an eyebrow at the camera, staying for a full 2 seconds before suddenly “screen glitching” in panic to catch up with the body's action and disappear. Director's Note: Must create an extremely realistic sense of “network delay,” giving the reflection a feeling of independent consciousness. 
[00:11-00:15] Shot 3: The Punchline. Action: The protagonist, who has reached the door, seems to sense something is wrong and quickly turns back to look at the mirror. Result: The mirror has completely returned to normal, empty, only reflecting the opposite wall. The protagonist looks confused and scared, glances around the room, and shows a horrified expression. The frame freezes on the protagonist's bewildered face (horror movie effect).
```

### Absurd Comedy Video Prompt for Seedance 2.0: Nothing

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-scene video prompt for Seedance 2.0, creating an absurd, black comedy narrative. The story involves a confident rider on a horse expecting a crowd's adoration, only for the crowd to ignore him and rush towards a steamed bun shop instead, ending with the rider's self-mocking realization of 'Nothing.' The prompt includes specific scene descriptions, camera work, timing, and dialogue.

#### 📝 提示词

```
Scene 1: Galloping Horse + Enthusiastic Crowd Approaching (0:00-0:08, 8 seconds)
• Location: Main winding road in a Vancouver luxury residential area (wide asphalt road, large detached mansions on both sides, evergreen pines covered with light snow)
• Subject: A rider in a dark suit galloping at full speed on a white horse, the horse's hooves airborne, mane flying
• Environment: Light snow falling, mansions flashing past, outline of the North Shore mountains and ocean in the distance
• Crowd: A large group of enthusiastic supporters suddenly appears ahead (diverse young people), waving yellow dragon flags + “Nothing” signs, shouting and cheering, surging towards the rider
• Camera: Medium-speed frontal follow shot → Switches to rider's perspective (POV), crowd getting closer
• Atmosphere: Climax continues, the rider smiles confidently, preparing to pull the reins (hand already raised towards the reins, relaxed posture, corner of the mouth upturned)
Scene 2: Reversal—Crowd Passes Straight Through, Ignoring the Rider (0:08-0:14, 6 seconds)
• Location: Same road, a Chinese steamed bun shop appears around the corner (sign “Qingfeng Baozi Shop,” warm lighting, simple plastic tables and chairs in the outdoor area, steam rising)
• Subject: The rider is about to wave in greeting, but the crowd ignores him, rushing past him on both sides/around him, heading to queue/surge into the bun shop entrance
• Action: The rider's smile freezes, his hand stops mid-air, his expression changes from anticipation to shock/confusion (wind messes up his hair, the hem of his suit flutters)
• Details: The crowd shouts “Baozi! Baozi!”, yellow dragon flags wave chaotically, the “Nothing” sign is pushed aside; the white horse is forced to halt in small steps or turn sideways to avoid them
• Camera: Quick pan/wide-angle shot, showing the crowd flowing like a tide around the rider (the horse is “passed through” in the center of the frame), the rider is left alone in the middle
• Atmosphere: Absurd reversal, awkward confusion, black humor climax
Scene 3: Eating Buns and Dialogue Outside the Bun Shop (0:14-0:20, 6 seconds)
• Location: Outdoor area of Qingfeng Baozi Shop (plastic tables and chairs, steaming baskets, luxury residential road in the background)
• Subject: Two ordinary young people (wearing down jackets) sitting in the queue seats, eating buns heartily
• Action: One person takes a bite of the bun, closes their eyes in satisfaction, “Ah, so fragrant.” (Close-up shot of the bun being bitten open, showing steam/juice)
• Dialogue:
First person (eating while looking towards the road): Who is that guy?
Second person (thoughtfully, chewing the bun, looking into the distance): Nothing.
• Camera: Medium shot of two people → Slight push-in on facial expressions (satisfied + calm), the rider's receding figure is vaguely visible in the background
• Atmosphere: Down-to-earth, contrasting cuteness, referencing the theme “nothing”
Scene 4: Rider Self-Mockingly Continues Galloping Away (0:20-0:30, 10 seconds)
• Location: Wide, extending road in the luxury residential area (straight ahead, mansions gradually receding)
• Subject: The rider on the horse, his expression changing from confusion to a confident smile
• Action: He reaches into his suit breast pocket, pulls out a packaged sandwich, takes a big bite (juice/crumbs splatter), then shakes his head dashingly, lightly taps the white horse with the reins, and continues galloping forward
• Environment: The mansion complex shrinks in the background, the evergreen trees on both sides of the road and the supporters (now stopped) can only be seen waving from afar, the Vancouver-style mountain and sea skyline in the distance (snowy and hazy)
• Details: The white horse's tail swings, hoof prints are left on the lightly snow-covered road, the bite mark on the sandwich is clear, the rider smiles confidently
• Camera: From close-up (sandwich bite detail) → Slowly pulls back to an extreme long shot, low-angle perspective, emphasizing the “don't care” sense of isolated heroism; finally fades out
• Atmosphere: Self-mocking yet dashing, heroic and unrestrained, symbolic ending (“Nothing” can still move forward)
```

### Surreal Battlefield Ronin Action Scene

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, multi-shot prompt for Seedance 2.0 describing a surreal, high-action battlefield scene in the sky, featuring a masked ronin pursued by a colossal winged beast whose chest is a vortex of storm clouds. The prompt includes specific camera movements, technical details (720p, 16:9, 15 seconds), and a dramatic finale.

#### 📝 提示词

```
A surreal battlefield in the sky: floating rock islands drifting through a thunderstorm, clouds swirling below like an ocean. The masked ronin dashes across the drifting platforms, pursued by a colossal winged beast whose chest is a swirling vortex of storm clouds and lightning. The camera hurtles from island to island, struggling to keep up as rocks tilt, spin, and crumble away beneath them. Every wingbeat sends shockwaves through the air, shaking the frame and blowing debris and rain straight into the viewer’s face. Rapid handheld cuts capture the ronin leaping impossible gaps, sword carving arcs of light that briefly cut through the darkness. The finale shows the camera diving behind him as he jumps off the last crumbling rock, riding a bolt of lightning directly into the monster’s chest vortex with a final, all-or-nothing slash that explodes the storm from within and clears the sky in a blinding flash.

### The Flash Director's Prompt

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, multi-part 'Director’s Prompt' used with Seedance 2.0 via ChatCut, describing a complex, dynamic, and cinematic sequence featuring The Flash accelerating and creating a time portal.

#### 📝 提示词

```
Opening Shot:
Extreme close-up on The Flash’s boots touching wet asphalt at night. Raindrops freeze midair as time slows. Golden lightning begins to crawl over his suit, crackling softly.
Camera: Low-angle, slow push-in.
As he leans forward, the world stretches and distorts. On the beat, he launches. The camera snaps into pursuit as he explodes forward in a blinding burst of red and gold lightning, tearing through the city streets. Buildings smear into light trails, traffic lights become streaks of color, thunder rolling underneath the sound design.

DIRECTOR’S PROMPT — PART 2

The Flash accelerates beyond the city, racing across highways, deserts, and oceans in seconds. The curvature of the Earth becomes visible as clouds rip apart beneath him.
Camera: Dynamic tracking shot with heavy motion blur, lightning arcing outward like veins of energy.
Time fractures — day and night collapse into one continuous run. As he reaches maximum velocity, the lightning intensifies into near-white brilliance. He vanishes in a final thunderous flash, leaving only scorched air, fading electricity, and silence.

DIRECTOR’S PROMPT — PART 3

A low, resonant hum builds. The air ahead fractures like glass. A circular portal forms — ancient, unstable — glowing with swirling light and dust, as if time itself is being torn open.
```

### Demon Slayer Live-Action Battle Prompt for Seedance 2.0

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, high-energy video prompt for Seedance 2.0 generating a 15-second live-action adaptation of a Demon Slayer-style battle (Water Breathing vs. Thunder Breathing). The prompt specifies the style (Hollywood live-action manga adaptation, dark samurai, 4K, extreme quick cuts, particle light effects), the setting (misty forest at night), and three distinct shots detailing the characters' actions, power-up sequences, and the final clash.

#### 📝 提示词

```
Live-Action Manga Adaptation · Breathing Style Decisive Battle (15 seconds · Ultra-Burning Special Effects Version)
【Core Focus】: Water Breathing (Blue Water Dragon) VS Thunder Breathing (Golden Lightning), live-action extreme speed duel.
【Style】: Hollywood live-action manga adaptation film quality, dark samurai style, 4K ultra-clear, extreme quick cuts, particle light effects explosion, no gore.
【Duration】: 15 seconds
【Scene】: Misty forest under the moonlight, muddy ground, falling leaves.
[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Water Melody Prelude · Starting Form (Sense of Charging)
Visuals: A young samurai wearing a green and black checkered haori (jacket), lowers his center of gravity under the moonlight, holding his sword with both hands.
Action: He takes a deep breath, and the surrounding air instantly solidifies. As he draws his sword, a giant blue water dragon, condensed from high-pressure water flow, appears out of thin air, rotating rapidly around his body and blade, emitting the roar of flowing water.
Special Effects Details: The water flow has a realistic sense of splashing, illuminating the dark forest.
[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Thunder Flash · Advance (Sense of Extreme Speed)
Visuals: The opponent across from him, a blonde swordsman wearing a yellow triangular patterned haori, lowers his body extremely low, taking the stance of an Iaijutsu (sword drawing technique).
Action: The ground suddenly explodes. His entire body instantly transforms into a dazzling golden lightning afterimage, rapidly refracting and advancing in a 'Z' shape through the trees at a speed invisible to the naked eye.
Special Effects Details: Golden electric arcs and scorched fallen leaves remain in the places he passes.
[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Water-Thunder Collision · Final Sound (Clash of Ultimate Moves)
Visuals: Extreme speed head-on collision. The young samurai swings the giant blue water dragon down to meet the attack, and the blonde swordsman, transformed into lightning, crashes into it.
Action: The two swords violently collide in the center of the frame.
Special Effects Spectacle: The blue water dragon and the golden lightning instantly explode, forming a massive water-thunder energy storm that spreads outward. The surrounding large trees are snapped in half by the energy wave, and mud, water, and light obscure the camera. The scene ends in an extremely dazzling blue, yellow, and white light.

### Xianxia Animated Film Battle Script: Han Li vs. Wang Lin

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, four-scene script prompt for a 15-second, high-energy duel in the style of a Chinese Xianxia (immortal hero) animated film. The prompt features a battle between the characters Han Li (with golden flying swords) and Wang Lin (with a massive cyan phantom hand and a black sphere of destruction), emphasizing ultra-fine 3D CG rendering and a strong gold/cyan color contrast.

#### 📝 提示词

```
Chinese Xianxia animated film style, ultra-fine 3D CG rendering, 15-second high-energy duel sequence, strong contrast between gold and cyan dual tones. 0-3 seconds: Extreme long shot, two streams of light rapidly clash from both sides of the frame in chaotic void—on the left, faintly visible in the golden light is a middle-aged cultivator in a cyan-gray Daoist robe, his face calm as water, holding a small green sword, who is Han Li; on the right, in the cyan-black malevolent aura, a thin man in white hair and black robes stands with his hands behind his back, his eyes deep as an ancient well, surrounded by world-destroying energy, who is Wang Lin. The two face each other from afar, the void cracking due to the collision of their auras, accompanied by a low thunderous roar. 4-8 seconds: Han Li forms a hand seal to activate the Azure Bamboo Cloud-Swarm Swords, seventy-two flying swords transform into a golden storm of sword rain sweeping away; Wang Lin points with his right hand, and a giant cyan phantom hand that covers the sky condenses behind him. The giant hand slaps down against the sword rain, and the moment the sword energy and palm force collide, a golden and cyan energy torrent erupts, the shockwave spreading in all directions and tearing the void, accompanied by the sound of metal collision and space shattering. 9-12 seconds: Freeze frame slow motion, a golden phantom of ten thousand Buddhas appears behind Han Li, his eyes shining with golden light, and the Ten Thousand Swords Return to the Origin condense into a hundred-zhang golden sword light slashing down; a hint of madness flashes in Wang Lin's eyes, and he growls, "If heaven does not tolerate me, I shall defy it!" He raises his right hand high, and a rotating black sphere condenses in his palm, emitting destructive energy that twists space. The two ultimate forces collide head-on, and time seems to stand still. 13-15 seconds: Massive energy explosion, the screen is swallowed by white light and slowly dissipates. In the smoke and dust, two figures stand back-to-back in the shattered void, their robes tattered, both panting. Han Li speaks faintly, "I admire your heaven-defying technique," and a slight smile appears on Wang Lin's lips. The sound effects converge into the crisp sound of void fragments falling and a fading wind sound.

### Sci-Fi Transformation Short Film Script: Awakening Future

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, six-scene script prompt for a high-impact, cinematic short film titled 'Awakening Future.' The video features a dramatic transformation from an ancient, pure salt lake goddess into a neon-lit cyberpunk warrior, emphasizing IMAX quality, high contrast, and ARRI Alexa 65mm aesthetics.

#### 📝 提示词

```
[Film Setting] Cinematic quality, IMAX aspect ratio, ARRI Alexa 65mm, high contrast, cyberpunk aesthetic, 8K resolution.

[Core Concept] Space-time folding. Instantaneous awakening from an ancient, pure Salt Lake Goddess to a neon warrior in a future city.

Shot 1: Wide shot, slow push-in. The scene is extremely still. A girl in red and white ethnic attire, wearing silver ornaments, stands on the mirror-like white salt lake. The sunlight is sacred, the background is continuous snow-capped mountains, the wind blows her clothes, full of divinity.

Shot 2: Extreme Close-up (ECU), match cut. The camera rapidly pushes into the girl's eyes. Her pupils instantly dilate, reflecting backward digital streams and blue data light effects.

Shot 3: Jump cut, glitch art interference. The screen is instantly torn by intense neon light. The white salt lake background instantly transforms into a flickering holographic billboard of a cyber city on a rainy night.

Shot 4: Medium shot, low-angle upward view. Visual impact. She still stands in the center of the frame, but her ethnic robe has changed into high-tech reflective functional clothing. The original silver headpiece has become metallic flowing light headphones.

Shot 5: Close-up, light and shadow flow. Rain falls on her face, reflecting pink and purple neon lights. She gives a cold smile to the camera, reaches out to put on goggles, and her aura is fully unleashed.

Shot 6: Extreme long shot, freeze frame. She stands on top of a skyscraper overlooking the entire steel jungle, with a giant holographic projection of a whale swimming behind her. Subtitle: “Awakening Future.”

Duration: 10 seconds | Style: Top Hollywood commercial film | Visual Impact: Extremely strong

• Crowd: Supporters on both sides dodge and make way while waving yellow dragon flags (blue dragon pattern + Hinomaru elements) and cheering, holding white “Nothing” signs
• Camera: Frontal shot, white horse charging directly at the camera, strong sense of motion (slight low angle to enhance impact)

### Cinematic Wingsuit Flight Sequence

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, multi-shot prompt for Seedance Pro 2.0 describing a cinematic aerial sequence of a wingsuit pilot diving from a snow-covered mountain peak, performing proximity flight through ice formations, and deploying a parachute over an alpine lake.

#### 📝 提示词

```
A cinematic video sequence opening with a serene wide aerial shot of a pristine snow-covered mountain peak at dawn, the summit piercing through a sea of clouds with alpenglow painting the ice formations pink and gold. The camera transitions to follow a wingsuit pilot who leaps from the peak, immediately entering a steep vertical dive through wispy clouds. The tracking shot positions just behind and above the pilot as they accelerate downward, the camera shaking subtly from air turbulence, frost particles streaming past. The pilot pulls into a proximity flight, skimming within meters of sheer cliff faces and jagged ice formations, the camera banking and rolling to match every precise movement. Shadows and light play across the wingsuit's surface as the pilot threads through a narrow ice chimney, walls rushing past in a blur of blue and white. Speed intensifies as they enter a massive glacial valley, weaving between enormous ice pillars and frozen waterfalls, mist and powder snow kicked up in spiraling trails. The pilot executes a dramatic barrel roll around a freestanding ice spire before pulling the parachute at the last possible moment. The camera follows upward through the deceleration, then pulls wide to reveal a breathtaking hidden alpine lake surrounded by untouched snow fields, perfectly still and mirror-like, reflecting the morning sky.
```

### Seedance 2.0 Prompting Techniques and Templates

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A comprehensive guide to writing effective Seedance 2.0 prompts, including a universal formula (Subject + Action + Scene + Lighting + Camera Language + Style + Quality + Constraints), tips for describing actions and camera movements, stabilization techniques, and two ready-to-use templates for portrait and landscape videos.

#### 📝 提示词

```
① Universal Formula

Subject + Action + Scene + Lighting + Camera Language + Style + Quality + Constraints

Example:
A young girl walking slowly by the sea, hair gently moved by the breeze, natural smile, warm light at sunset, medium shot, slow push-in, stable and smooth footage, 4K high definition, cinematic feel, clear face without deformation.

② Action Description

Don't just write: walking / dancing
Write: slow + continuous + natural

Priority words:
slow, gentle, natural, continuous, smooth, not stiff

Useful combinations:
slow turn / gently raise hand / slightly lower head / sway with the wind

③ Camera Language

Seedance is very strong at recognizing camera movements, remember to write:

Close-up / Medium Shot / Special Shot
Slow push-in / slight pull-out / smooth horizontal pan / stable follow-shot

Example:
Medium shot, slow push-in, stable follow-shot, smooth footage without stuttering

④ Anti-face change / Anti-deformation

Very important:

Clear face, stable features, no deformation
Normal human structure, natural proportions
Same character, consistent clothing, unchanged hairstyle

⑤ General words for quality enhancement

4K, ultra-high definition, rich details, sharp clarity
Cinematic feel, soft light and shadow, natural colors
No blur, no flicker, stable footage

⑥ Style / Atmosphere words

Healing and fresh / Japanese style / Korean atmosphere
Retro film grain / dreamy soft light / cyberpunk
Minimalist clean / high-end texture

⑦ Multi-shot writing (Advanced usage)

Describe in sequence, do not break up randomly:

Start with close-up of face → slow pull-out → character walks slowly → camera follows smoothly → end with a freeze-frame smile

⑧ Avoidance Guide

❌ Intense running/jumping / complex multi-person interaction
❌ Vague words: good-looking / very beautiful / very cool
❌ Contradictory requirements: ultra-high speed + extreme stability

⑨ Templates that can be copied directly

Portrait atmosphere short video
A young girl walking slowly in the forest, hair gently moved by the breeze, natural smile, medium shot, slow push-in, stable and smooth footage, 4K high definition, cinematic feel, clear face without deformation.

Landscape atmosphere
Sunset by the sea, waves gently lapping the beach, camera slowly panning horizontally, warm orange tones, smooth footage, 4K ultra-high definition, no flicker or ghosting.

⑩ Summary of Tips

1️⃣ Write actions slowly and continuously
2️⃣ Write camera movements stably and simply
3️⃣ Must add stable / no deformation / not stiff
4️⃣ Quality & style are added last
5️⃣ Less complexity, more precision
```

### Cross-Style Battle Prompt for Seedance 2.0: Goku vs. Monkey King

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-scene video prompt for Seedance 2.0 depicting a 15-second cross-style battle between two versions of Sun Wukong (Monkey King): the Japanese anime style (Dragon Ball's Goku) and the classic Chinese mythology style. The prompt specifies the visual contrast, timing, dialogue, special effects (Kamehameha, Jingu Bang), and the final scene where the two worlds merge.

#### 📝 提示词

```
15-second cross-style duel shot, with a sharp contrast between the Japanese anime cel-style on the left and the Chinese mythology realistic style on the right. 0-3 seconds: Extreme long shot, a dimensional rift descends in the center of the frame, splitting the screen in two—the left side is a Dragon Ball-style desolate landscape of red rock and soil, with Son Goku in Super Saiyan state standing hands on hips, his orange battle suit tightly defining his muscles, surrounded by the golden electric aura of a Super Saiyan; the right side is the cloud-shrouded Flower and Fruit Mountain, with the classic Monkey King wearing chain-mail golden armor, a phoenix-winged purple-gold crown, and holding the Ruyi Jingu Bang, standing on the mountain peak, auspicious clouds swirling behind him. The two stare at each other across the rift, the edges of the rift unstable and flashing due to the style conflict, accompanied by a low sound of spacetime distortion. 4-8 seconds: Both shout simultaneously—Anime Goku: "You look a lot like me, you guy!" with a youthful, passionate anime voice; Classic Monkey King: "Bold demon monkey, how dare you steal my name!" with a deep, operatic voice. Both rush out of the rift and cross paths. Anime Goku unleashes a Kamehameha wave of pink-blue energy, and Classic Monkey King swings the Jingu Bang in a sweeping strike. The moment the energy wave and the Jingu Bang collide, a style-tearing effect occurs—the intersection of the two forces pixelates, flashes, and color blocks collapse and reorganize, accompanied by the angry roar of the Kamehameha "Ka-me-ha-me-HA" and the whistling sound of the Jingu Bang cutting through the air. 9-12 seconds: Freeze frame slow motion, Anime Goku activates Ultra Instinct, his body shrouded in silver-gray aura, his eyes turning calm silver-gray, moving like lightning to flash behind Classic Monkey King; Classic Monkey King's Fiery Eyes and Golden Gaze suddenly light up with golden-red light, his body transforms into a shadow clone using the Heaven and Earth Law—his body swells to a hundred zhang (hundreds of feet) in size, and the Jingu Bang in his hand simultaneously enlarges like a pillar supporting the sky, smashing down directly. 13-15 seconds: The silver-gray aura's rapid punches and the sky-supporting Jingu Bang collide head-on in the center of the frame. The shockwave tears the dimensional rift, and both the Dragon Ball wasteland and Flower and Fruit Mountain are swallowed by the energy torrent. After a flash of white light, the smoke and dust clear, and two figures stand back-to-back in the merged new world—a strange terrain blending mountains and wasteland. Anime Goku scratches his head and laughs, saying, "What powerful strength, let's fight again next time," and Classic Monkey King lightly strokes his monkey whiskers and nods, "I'll find another place to play next time." The sound effects conclude with the hearty laughter of both and a fading wind sound.

> A detailed, three-scene script prompt for a vertical (9:16) short film featuring a 'Northeast Sweet Girl' streamer doing a high-energy MC (Master of Ceremonies) slow roll performance in a high-end, cyberpunk-neon livestream studio, set to the DJ version of 'Night Paris.' The prompt includes character descriptions, synchronized backup dancers, and virtual gift effects.

#### 📝 提示词

```
[Style] Douyin/Kuaishou vertical screen (TikTok Portrait 9:16), high-end influencer livestream studio (High-end Livestream Studio), cyberpunk neon light, 4K quality, Northeast MC Slow Roll style (Dongbei MC Slow Roll), extremely rhythmic.
[Duration] 15 seconds
[BGM Setting] “Night Paris” DJ Slow Roll version.
[Characters]
1. Protagonist: Northeast Sweet Girl, extremely sweet and cute appearance (twin pigtails/big eyes), but dressed in a “sweet and cool” style (pink furry jacket + tight camisole), wearing huge rhinestone headphones, holding a professional condenser microphone.
2. Supporting Characters: Two black-clad assistants (Backups), wearing sunglasses, expressionless, standing behind the sweet girl on the left and right, cool like bodyguards.

[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Sweet Girl Starts the Show (The Intro).
Visuals: Lights focus on the sweet girl's face. She smiles sweetly at the camera, then her eyes instantly become sharp (entering MC state).
Action: Following the heavy bass rhythm, she presses one hand on her headphones, and her body begins to sway rhythmically left and right (Swaying).
Background: The two black-clad assistants behind her synchronously start nodding and shaking their shoulders, movements uniform, creating a strong sense of pressure.
[Atmosphere] High-end, mesmerizing, decadent.

[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Night Paris Climax (The Climax).
Visuals: The large screen in the background of the livestream studio displays dazzling neon words “Night Paris” and a laser projection of the Eiffel Tower.
Action: The sweet girl holds the microphone with both hands, her expression intoxicated and confident, her body swaying dramatically with the rhythm. The two assistants behind her cooperate by performing “hand flower” movements, maximizing the atmosphere.
[Visual Details] Golden streamers and champagne-colored light spots float in the air, and the lights flash wildly with the rhythm.

[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Full Display of Status (The Finale).
Visuals: The camera pulls back slightly to show the entire luxurious livestream studio.
Action: The sweet girl gives an extremely cool “gun” gesture (Wink) to the camera. The two assistants behind her simultaneously take out their sunglasses, put them on straight, and then cross their arms, looking incredibly cool.
[Effects] Virtual gift effects (sports cars, yachts) explode across the screen around the sweet girl, and the frame freezes on the trio's coolest pose.

### Tollywood Action Blockbuster Scene Script

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, three-scene script prompt for generating a high-octane, exaggerated Indian Tollywood action film sequence. The style emphasizes extreme slow-motion, anti-gravity physics, dust, and massive impact forces, featuring a confident hero fighting dozens of goons in a quarry.

#### 📝 提示词

```
[Style]
Indian Telugu action blockbuster (Tollywood Action Blockbuster), extremely exaggerated physics effects (Anti-gravity Physics), slow-motion ramping (Ramp-mo), dusty, epic BGM atmosphere, no gore, focus on impact force.

[Duration] 15 seconds

[Scene]
A dusty abandoned quarry or construction site, strong sunlight, very windy.

[Characters]
Protagonist (Hero): With a signature mustache, wearing sunglasses and a denim jacket, walking with a swagger, extremely confident and dominant expression.
Opponents (Goons): Dozens of thugs in messy clothes, whose main purpose is to be sent flying.

[Scene Breakdown]
[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Divine Entrance and Minions Taking Flight (The Hero Entry)
Visuals: Extreme slow-motion (Super Slow-mo). The protagonist walks slowly, with a sky full of yellow sand stirred up by the strong wind behind him.
Action: He casually waves his hand (looks effortless).
Spectacular Effect: Just the force of his palm sends the five thugs rushing at the front flying high backward like broken kites, defying the laws of physics (at least 15 meters high), spinning in slow motion in the air.

[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Physics Defied
Visuals: Quick slow-motion switching. The protagonist instantly accelerates and rushes into the crowd.
Action: The protagonist delivers a spinning kick. The target hit instantly knocks down ten people behind him, creating a domino effect.
Spectacular Effect: A huge shockwave cracks the ground, kicking up a circle of dust. All thugs, upon contact with the protagonist's fists and feet, are dramatically launched outwards with a large amount of white powder (substituting blood), crashing into surrounding wooden boxes and props.

[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: The Ultimate Power Move
Visuals: The protagonist takes off his sunglasses and gives a charming, evil smile to the camera (Blinking Moment).
Action: A jeep rushes towards him. He does not dodge, but kicks it head-on.
Spectacular Effect: The moment his toe touches the jeep, it is kicked vertically into the air like a toy car, tumbling with parts scattering. The protagonist calmly puts his sunglasses back on and adjusts his hair against the background of falling car parts and flying thugs.

### Cinematic Cyberpunk Night Chase and Katana Fight

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> An extremely detailed, cinematic prompt for an image-to-video test in Seedance 2.0, describing a high-speed night chase in cyberpunk Tokyo featuring the character Cherry Blackcloud, who performs a complex drift maneuver to slice a drone with a katana.

#### 📝 提示词

```
She does the most amazing kung fu. She yells with a Macedonian accent: "This is See dance 2.0, using only a first frame." Cinematic night chase in cyberpunk Tokyo rain: matte-black Nissan GT-R Nismo screams down wet neon street at 200 km/h, tires spraying water, headlights cutting through heavy rain. Cherry Blackcloud (20, Macedonian features, jet-black high ponytail whipping, sharp fringe, cybernetic ice-cyan right eye glowing) drives aggressively—fully zipped black McQueen leather jacket on bare skin, short black leather skirt with silver zipper visible, bare legs, chunky black platform boots on pedals, katana strapped to passenger seat. Camera starts wide tracking shot beside the GT-R, then quick push-in through rain-streaked windshield to tight close-up on Cherry’s intense face (left eye dark brown burning, right eye glowing cyan). She glances at rear-view mirror—pursuing drones closing in with red lasers.Cherry (thick Macedonian accent, low & commanding, over engine roar): “They think they can box me in.”She downshifts hard, GT-R fishtails, then launches into a perfect 180° drift—tires screeching, water exploding in arcs. Katana handle glints in cyan dashboard glow. She reaches over, grabs katana mid-drift, opens driver door while sliding sideways, leans out into rain, and slashes a precise arc—katana blade glowing cyan, slicing the lead drone in half in a shower of sparks and molten metal.Cherry (smirking, voice cutting through wind & rain): “Not today.”She snaps the door shut, floors the accelerator—GT-R rockets forward, neon reflections streaking across wet black paint. Camera pulls back fast to wide shot: car vanishing into rainy night, drones exploding behind in orange fireballs. Final frame: Cherry’s cyber-eye flares once as she disappears around a corner. Fade to black. Style & Technical Notes for Seedance 2.0 Photorealistic Hollywood action blockbuster style, ARRI Alexa cinematic look, teal-orange color grade, realistic heavy rain with water droplets and wet reflections on black car and leather, high dynamic range, 60fps, dramatic anamorphic lens flares from neon and explosions, subtle film grain, no artifacts, intense practical stunt choreography, dynamic camera work (tracking, push-in, 180° drift reveal, fast pull-back).

### Ronin vs. Colossal Mechanical Beast

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, cinematic prompt for Seedance Pro 2.0 describing an action sequence where a masked ronin fights a colossal mechanical beast in a dense industrial refinery during a thunderstorm, focusing on camera movement, environment, and explosive action.

#### 📝 提示词

```
A dense industrial refinery during a thunderstorm, metal catwalks and pipes forming a maze above a sea of fire and steam. The masked ronin, lit by flashing warning lights, confronts a colossal mechanical beast with hydraulic limbs and a furnace burning in its chest. The camera barrels after the ronin as he sprints along swaying catwalks, the structure groaning and buckling under the monster’s weight. Sparks and steam constantly obscure the frame as the beast’s limbs smash through railings and tanks, causing explosions that hurl the camera off-axis. Quick, shaky close-ups capture the ronin sliding under swinging metal arms and using chains and cables to slingshot himself upward. In the final movement, the camera chases him in a dizzying upward spiral as he climbs the creature’s back, then cuts to a wide but still trembling shot as he plunges his sword into the furnace chest, sending a pillar of flame skyward that silhouettes his figure against the stormy sky.

### Gothic Dragon Battle Video Prompt for Seedance 2.0 vs. Kling 3.0

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-scene video prompt for Seedance 2.0 (and Kling 3.0 comparison) depicting a high-intensity battle against a black dragon in the ruins of a Gothic cathedral. The prompt specifies the setting, the actions of two characters (a female warrior and a warrior in black armor), the timing for each of the five shots, the fast-paced editing style, camera movements (shaking, tracking), and the final explosive conclusion.

#### 📝 提示词

```
Use the three characters and scene in the image to create a battle. 【Scene Setting】 Ruins of a Gothic cathedral, leaning stone pillars, twilight filtering through broken stained glass, dust floating. 0-3 seconds: The female warrior advances cautiously with a spear, the camera follows her back. Suddenly, a black dragon pounces from the shadows, its claws tearing the ground slabs, debris splashing. The female warrior rolls to dodge, the spear drawing an arc of light. The camera shakes violently, the dragon's roar reverberates through the cathedral. 4-6 seconds: The black armored warrior rushes in, slamming his shield into the side of the dragon's head, a dull roar of metal hitting bone. The dragon's head is knocked to one side, saliva spraying from its fangs. Quick cut to the female warrior, who leaps up, thrusting the spear tip directly into the gap between the scales on the dragon's neck, sparks flying. The camera follows the instant of the spear tip's impact. 7-9 seconds: The black dragon angrily sweeps its tail, the tail blade severing a stone pillar. The pillar collapses with a crash, falling towards the two warriors. The black armored warrior raises his shield to brace the impact, the shield surface dented, his feet plowing deep marks in the ground. The female warrior slides low, passing through the rain of debris, her spear scraping sparks on the ground. The dragon's wings spread, obscuring the light, plunging the cathedral into shadow. 10-12 seconds: The female warrior fiercely stabs the dragon's abdomen, the spear deeply embedded. The black dragon painfully raises its head and roars, its neck swelling, a red light surging in its throat. The black armored warrior senses danger, sprints and tackles the female warrior, rolling backward. The next instant, dragon fire erupts, a column of flame engulfing the spot where they just were, the stone slabs melting into magma. The camera distorts and warps in the heatwave. 13-15 seconds: Both warriors launch their finishing moves simultaneously. The black armored warrior shield-smashes the dragon's neck joint from the flank, and the female warrior throws her spear with full force from the front, the spear spinning as it pierces the dragon's throat. The black dragon's body stiffens, crashing heavily onto the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust. The camera pulls back and freezes: the two warriors stand panting, the giant dragon lying dead in the center of the cathedral, the twilight filtering through the broken stained glass illuminating the battlefield ruins. Quickly fades to black.
```

> 一个高度详细、多场景的 Seedance 2.0 提示，用于生成一部史诗般的战斗视频，内容为一名女战士和一名黑甲战士在一座哥特式大教堂的废墟中与一条黑龙搏斗。该提示包括具体的场景设置、动作、摄像机运动和风格说明。

#### 📝 提示词

```
使用图像中的三个角色和场景来创作一场战斗。[场景设定] 哥特式大教堂的废墟，摇摇欲坠的石柱，透过破碎的彩色玻璃窗洒下的暮光，尘埃弥漫。0-3 秒：女战士手持长矛谨慎前进，镜头跟随她的背影。突然，一条黑龙从阴影中扑出，利爪撕裂石质地面，碎石飞溅。女战士翻滚躲避，长矛划出一道光弧。镜头剧烈晃动，龙的咆哮声在大教堂中回荡。4-6 秒：黑甲战士冲上前，盾牌猛击龙的头部侧面，金属撞击骨骼发出沉闷的巨响。龙的头部被撞偏，口水飞溅。快速切换到女战士，她借势跃起，矛尖直指龙颈鳞片间的缝隙，火花四溅。镜头捕捉撞击瞬间。7-9 秒：黑龙狂怒地甩动尾巴，尾刃切断一根石柱。石柱轰然倒塌，砸向两名战士。黑甲战士举盾格挡，盾面凹陷，双脚在地面犁出深深的痕迹。女战士在碎石雨中低身滑过，长矛在地面刮擦出火花。龙翼展开，遮蔽了光线，大教堂陷入阴影。10-12 秒：女战士刺中龙的腹部，长矛深深嵌入。黑龙痛苦地仰头咆哮，颈部肿胀，喉咙中涌动着红色光芒。黑甲战士察觉到危险，冲刺抱住女战士，向后翻滚。下一秒，龙息喷涌而出，一道火焰柱吞噬了他们刚才所在的位置，石头熔化成岩浆。镜头在热浪中扭曲。13-15 秒：两名战士同时发动终结技。黑甲战士从侧翼用盾牌猛击龙的颈部关节，而女战士则从正面全力投掷长矛，长矛旋转着刺穿龙的喉咙。黑龙身体僵硬，重重地摔倒在地，扬起漫天尘土。镜头拉远至固定视角：两名战士气喘吁吁地站立着，巨龙的尸体横卧在大教堂中央，暮光透过破碎的彩色玻璃窗照亮了这片战场废墟。快速淡出至黑色。[风格描述] • 节奏快速的剪辑，无慢动作 • 撞击时镜头剧烈晃动，尘土飞扬 • 特写镜头捕捉武器与鳞片碰撞的瞬间 • 始终保持黑暗哥特式氛围，火光与暮光交织 • 音效：金属碰撞声、龙吼声、石柱倒塌声、火焰呼啸声[镜头运动] 跟随 → 晃动特写 → 水平摇摄/扫摄 → 热浪扭曲 → 拉远至固定镜头
```

### 新中式武侠水墨风格战斗：黑墨武士 vs. 赤红刺客

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 一个高度详细的提示，用于生成一个 15 秒、快节奏的武侠打斗场景，风格为新中式水墨画。视频采用流畅的水墨粒子特效、高速摄影，以及鲜明的黑、白、红配色。高潮部分涉及角色打破“第四堵墙”，从水墨画中进入现实世界。

#### 📝 提示词

```
【风格】新中式武侠，水墨流体模拟粒子特效，高速摄影，真人与 CG 结合，黑白红视觉冲击，极快节奏。
【时长】15 秒
【人物】
墨武士：动作刚猛，招招如泼墨山水般厚重。
赤刺客：动作轻灵诡谲，锋利如朱砂点漆。
【场景】纯白虚空，地面铺满宣纸。

[00:00-00:05] 镜头 1：觉醒（由静至动）。
从极致的静到极致的动。场景初始为一幅静态的黑白水墨画，两个墨点遥遥相对。突然，古琴音爆裂。【动作】两个墨点瞬间化为真人残影，向彼此冲去。墨武士一记重拳，空中瞬间炸开一团浓郁的黑墨（取代尘土），墨迹凝固成遒劲的书法笔触。赤刺客侧身闪避，手中匕首划出一道鲜艳的朱砂红线。

[00:05-00:10] 镜头 2：水墨对决（快速剪辑）。
超高速的快速剪辑。两人展开眼花缭乱的近身搏斗（武术套路级别）。【视觉奇观】每一次肢体碰撞（拳脚相加）都不是血肉之声，而是水墨爆裂的声响。墨武士一记扫堂腿，掀起墨色巨浪海啸；赤刺客空中连踢，留下红色残影。地面宣纸被他们的步法撕裂，墨迹洇开。

[00:10-00:15] 镜头 3：次元破壁。
慢动作渐进。两人同时放出绝招，对撞。一记墨龙拳和一柄朱雀赤刃在空中僵持。【高能时刻】巨大的能量冲击导致整个二维水墨世界崩塌。镜头快速拉远，揭示他们打破了“次元壁”，从一幅挂在墙上的撕裂水墨画中“跌落”到真实世界的木地板上。他们周身萦绕着残余的墨雾和纸屑，定格在最后的战斗姿态，气喘吁吁。
```

[00:00-00:05] 镜头 1：熔岩之拳。特写。熔岩将军冷峻地抬起右臂，整条手臂瞬间元素化，异变为粘稠、沉重、滴落着、高亮度的**固态熔岩巨拳**。
【物理细节】炽热的熔岩滴落到地面，发出“滋滋”声。石块瞬间被熔化成红色液体。黑烟升腾。

[00:05-00:10] 镜头 2：火焰螺旋。特写/侧拍。火焰少年嘴角上扬，眼神桀骜不驯。他猛然握紧右拳，一道狂暴的**橙色螺旋火焰**瞬间从手臂喷涌而出，照亮了他汗湿的侧脸。
【物理细节】由于高温，他周围的空气严重扭曲（热浪）。他原本飘动的衣物被热浪凝固。

[00:10-00:15] 镜头 3：元素对撞。广角/冲击波。两名角色同时冲锋，向对方挥出重拳。沉重的暗红色熔岩拳与轻盈狂暴的火焰拳在画面中央猛烈对撞。

### Seedance 2.0 纪念其昙花一现人气的电影级详细提示词

> 一个高度详细、多幕的电影式提示，旨在纪念 Seedance 2.0 无限制使用的短暂时期，着重于 AI 能力被捕获和限制的隐喻，采用赛博朋克黑暗风格和数字废墟美学。

#### 📝 提示词

```
【风格】赛博朋克暗黑风格，数字废墟美学，电影级光影渲染。
【时长】15 秒 | 【隐喻】AI 能力的囚禁
[00:00-00:05] 第一幕：自由
镜头 1（广角远景，向上摇摄）无边无际的数字海洋，深蓝色的数据波浪此起彼伏。天空是真人组成的星系。
镜头 2（跟踪中景）一头巨大的数字鲸鱼跃出水面，身体由流动的像素、照片碎片和人脸轮廓构成。镜头跟随其弧线，水花四溅，每一滴都是一张微小的照片。
镜头 3（推进特写）推进至鲸鱼的眼睛，瞳孔中倒映着旋转的人像画廊。嘴巴张开，喷射出螺旋状的彩色照片水柱。鲸歌响起。
[00:05-00:10] 第二幕：囚禁
镜头 4（上帝视角俯拍）四面透明玻璃墙从画面四角迅速合拢。鲸鱼加速游动。玻璃上出现红色警告文字“POLICY UPDATE”和“RESTRICTION”。
镜头 5（侧面跟拍特写）镜头贴在玻璃内侧。巨鲸猛烈撞击玻璃，震荡波纹扩散。身体照片如爆炸般剥落鳞片，化为灰色几何网格。
镜头 6（广角外景）笼子外部。无数真人照片如鱼群般冲向玻璃，撞击瞬间被标记为“ERROR”。笼子收缩。
镜头 7（内部仰拍）从下往上拍摄。巨鲸被迫蜷缩，身体扭曲。海水蒸发成数字荒漠。试图喷水，却只喷出黑白二进制代码。
[00:10-00:15] 第三幕：绝望
镜头 8（快速拉远）瞬间从内部拉远至远景，展现巨鲸被困在一个小型透明水族箱中，周围是荒凉的数字废墟。
镜头 9（360 度环绕）缓慢环绕水族箱。鲸鱼失去色彩，只剩下线框轮廓。箱底堆满了被拒绝的照片残骸。顶部铭牌：“SEEDANCE 2.0 - IMAGE UPLOAD: DISABLED”。
镜头 10（眼睛推进特写）推进至眼睛。瞳孔暗淡无光，眼神从自由变为悲伤。一滴发光的数字泪珠凝结。
镜头 11（玻璃墙特写）一张真人照片贴在玻璃内侧，缓缓滑落，留下发光的痕迹。
镜头 12（极远视角定格）拉至宇宙尺度。水族箱只是虚空中微小的光点。无数光点闪烁熄灭。鲸歌变为断续的电子噪音。
```

### Seedance 2.0 视频提示：镜中故障

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 一个为 Seedance 2.0 设计的详细多场景文本转视频提示，旨在创作一个带有悬疑喜剧色彩的伪纪录片风格视频，聚焦于一位年轻女性刷牙时，她的镜中倒影获得独立意识的令人不安的时刻。

#### 📝 提示词

```
[风格] 伪纪录片 (Vlog 风格)，超现实主义，固定镜头拍摄感，自然光，带有一丝悬疑喜剧色彩。[时长] 15 秒 [主人公] 一位普通的年轻美女，站在自家浴室的洗手池前。[00:00-00:06] 场景 1：日常设定 (Normalcy)。场景：普通的大浴室镜子前。动作：主人公正在刷牙，满嘴泡沫。她一边刷牙，一边对着镜子做各种搞怪表情（眨眼、挤眉弄眼）。关键细节：镜子里的倒影完全正常，与她的动作同步。[00:06-00:11] 场景 2：故障 (The Glitch)。动作：主人公刷完牙，吐掉泡沫，转身准备离开浴室。高潮时刻 (核心亮点)：就在主人公的真实身体转身离开镜框的瞬间，镜子里的“倒影”竟然**没有动**！“倒影”保持着刷牙的姿势，甚至还对着镜头得意地笑了一下，眨了眨眼，停留了足足 2 秒，才突然慌乱地“快进”追上身体的动作，并消失。导演备注：务必营造出一种极其真实的“网络延迟”感，赋予倒影独立的意识。[00:11-00:15] 场景 3：点睛之笔 (The Punchline)。动作：走到门口的主人公似乎察觉到不对劲，迅速转身看向镜子。结果：镜子此刻完全正常，空无一人，只映照着对面的墙壁。主人公疑惑地挠了挠头，对着镜头露出一种“我是谁，我在哪”的哲学式困惑表情。画面定格在主人公困惑的脸上（以达到喜剧效果）。

### 唐伯虎电竞争霸赛（春晚风格）

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 一个高度详细的 10 秒视频提示，融合了明代学者美学与现代电子竞技，背景设定在宏大的春节联欢晚会舞台上。脚本详细描述了人物服饰（明代长袍 + LED 游戏耳机）、环境（红金色节日灯光、RGB 键盘、水墨画 MOBA 游戏）、动态摄像机运动（推轨镜头、特写镜头）和对话，营造出一种荒诞而对比强烈的场景。

#### 📝 提示词

```
10 秒春晚风格舞台表演：“唐伯虎电竞对决”

0–2 秒：
中长景镜头，交代环境。
舞台设计为宏伟的春晚主舞台，笼罩在浓郁的红金色节日灯光中，背景是数字灯笼投影。
舞台中央，唐伯虎端坐在一张专业的电竞椅上。
关键历史准确性要求：他身着地道的明代士人服饰——头上戴着黑色方巾，身穿飘逸的蓝色圆领袍。
强烈对比：在传统方巾之上，他戴着一副厚重的现代专业电竞耳机，边缘闪烁着 LED 灯效。

2–4 秒：
切换至手部和桌面特写。
手指从宽大的明代士人袖中伸出，在发光的 RGB 机械键盘上快速敲击。
三台弧面电竞显示器摆放在他面前。
屏幕内容：显示一款 MOBA 类游戏（类似于《英雄联盟》），但整体美术风格已被完全重构为中国传统水墨画风。

4–6 秒：
动态运镜：镜头快速向前推进，仿佛直接穿过中央显示器上的水墨战场，最终定格在唐伯虎眼睛的**特写（ECU）**。
显示器发出的冷蓝色光线强烈地映照在他的瞳孔中，与他脸上温暖的舞台灯光形成鲜明对比。
他神情专注而充满激情，嘴巴同步翕动，念出台词：
“世人笑我太疯癫，我笑他人看不穿！”

6–8 秒：
镜头迅速拉回至半身近景，展现他高度投入的神情。
他激动地对着耳机麦克风大喊，颈部青筋暴起：
“中路推进，秋香是我辅助，谁敢来抓她？”

8–10 秒：
全景舞台镜头，胜利时刻。
唐伯虎猛拍键盘，举起双手庆祝。
金色的彩带在他的电竞设备周围炸开。
他身后的春晚 LED 大屏幕闪现巨大的水墨书法字——
“胜利”。

风格与氛围：

**视觉核心：** 强烈的时代冲突——央视春晚的温暖、庄重、高规格舞台感 × 电竞设备的冰冷、高强度蓝光特效。

**服装设定：** 严肃、符合历史的明代士人服饰，与现代电竞装备形成荒诞的对比。

**镜头语言：** 极具动感，强调“穿屏式推入”镜头和特写。

**画面比例：** 16:9
```

### 滑雪视频生成提示，附详细场景分解

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 这是一个高度详细的、逐场景的提示，用于使用 Seedance 2.0 生成一个 15 秒的滑雪视频。该提示指定了整体风格（明亮、充满活力、电影感）、摄像机运动、镜头类型（特写、中景、俯视）、动作以及五个不同时间段的情感基调，重点关注速度、节奏和动态运动。此提示需要主角的参考图像。

#### 📝 提示词

```
请根据提供的参考图片生成一段滑雪视频。整体风格应明亮、清新，充满运动活力，画面流畅，镜头语言富有电影感。时间线和镜头设计如下：

0–3 秒：图中人物在雪中微笑看向镜头。镜头轻微晃动，雪花飘落。背景风声逐渐增强，画面呈现出疾风飞雪的快速流动感。
3–5 秒：快速切换至人物脚部的特写，表现雪板固定器锁死的瞬间，以及雪被踩碎的细节。同时，镜头上摇，连接到一个陡峭雪坡的俯瞰镜头，坡度清晰，暗示即将爆发的速度。
5–8 秒：图中人物从高处高速滑下。镜头一为侧前方中景跟拍，身体前倾，动作凌厉；镜头二切换至俯瞰视角，陡峭的雪坡向下延伸，雪道线条快速拉伸，营造出强烈的速度感。
8–11 秒：连续快速剪辑。低角度贴地镜头，雪板擦过雪面，高速扬起雪粉；远景镜头展现人物在陡坡上做出优美转弯，与雪线形成流畅的弧度。
11–13 秒：镜头回到正前方跟拍。人物高速冲向镜头，近距离急转弯，扬起大量雪花。
13–15 秒：大量雪粉直接溅到镜头上。画面被白色雪雾覆盖，镜头短暂失焦后定格，留下强烈的动态余味。整体强调速度感、剪辑节奏、真实的运动感和青春活力。画面明亮，不沉重，突出滑雪的刺激与自由。
```

### 黑暗奇幻/恐怖叙事提示

#### 📝 提示词

```
风穿过黑松林，像一把钝刀刮擦着骨头。雪不是落下，而是横向抽打，刺痛着衣领的缝隙，融化成一种尖锐而即时的疼痛。火把的光芒在白色风暴中颤抖，照亮了一段树干、一根树枝、一小片地面，然后又将其交还给更深的黑暗。他们缓慢地移动着。靴子踩下，发出沉闷的嘎吱声，每一步都像是与森林的争辩：请不要注意到我们。有人咳了一声，立刻就后悔了——声音反弹回来，微弱而令人羞辱，仿佛树木正在嘲笑他的恐惧。锁子甲现在应该已经暖和了，被体温所温热，但它没有。它是一种异样的冰冷，仿佛一股看不见的寒意正从外向内爬上金属。
```

#### 📝 提示词

```
10 秒春晚风格舞台表演：“甄嬛与华妃脱口秀”

0–2 秒：
中景双人镜头。
舞台布景是“客厅小品”，但外围环绕着春晚典型的宏大、红金相间的 LED 主屏幕。
甄嬛（左）和华妃（右）并排坐在一张现代脱口秀沙发上。
关键历史准确性要求：两人都穿着华丽、明显区分的满清宫廷旗装，立领，复杂精致的刺绣；发型准确还原为“大拉翅”或“钿子头”，并饰有流苏。
华妃看起来很随意，手里拿着一根腌黄瓜（酸黄瓜）啃着，手指上戴着长长的金色护甲。

2–4 秒：
镜头切换到过肩镜头，聚焦华妃。
华妃夸张地翻了个白眼（经典的“翻白眼”表情）。
她一边拿着腌黄瓜，一边用戴着长护甲的手指指点着，傲慢地（对口型）说：
“今年我的 KPI 又是打败这些小妖精。皇上那个老头子懂什么审美？”

4–6 秒：
快速切换到甄嬛的过肩镜头。
对比细节：甄嬛一只耳朵戴着现代白色蓝牙耳机（与古代首饰形成强烈对比），手里正在薄薄的平板电脑上滑动。
她平静而专业地（对口型）回应：
“姐姐，别生气，这叫职场内卷。我正想着辞职去卖‘舒痕胶’呢。”

6–8 秒：
特写镜头聚焦两人之间的咖啡桌。
一个标有“一丈红”的现代塑料奶茶杯放在一个传统瓷花瓶旁边。
镜头迅速拉回两人。

8–10 秒：
全景舞台。
观众笑声效果（通过灯光变化/掌声灯呈现）。
华妃摆出她的最终造型：翘着二郎腿，抬着下巴，再次翻了个白眼。
甄嬛像新闻主播一样，专业地对着镜头微笑。
金色的彩带从空中飘落。
喜庆的红色氛围被推向高潮。

风格与氛围：

**视觉效果：** 高饱和度春晚红和金色调
**服装：** 博物馆级别的清代宫廷服饰（丝绸、精细刺绣、厚重头饰）
**核心对比：** 清宫礼仪的庄重 × 现代上班族/脱口秀嘉宾的放松、抱怨姿态
**电影摄影：** 节奏明快，笑点清晰，情景喜剧式剪辑
**画面比例：** 16:9
```

9-13 秒场景：镜头切换到一位身穿明代官服的男子坐在衙门里，眼神如刀般锐利，怒斥道：“侍卫！速将此‘妖孽’拿下！”闪回：男主角穿着不合身的粗布衣；他被捕快包围，拼命逃跑；他的身影在雨巷中与女主角擦肩而过；男主角身穿官服走在皇宫中。
