### Horror Short Film Script: The Mirror Glitch

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, three-scene script prompt for a pseudo-documentary (Vlog style) short film with a suspenseful, slightly horrific tone. The plot centers on a young woman brushing her teeth, where the reflection in the mirror exhibits a delayed, independent consciousness before glitching and disappearing, leaving the protagonist confused and scared. Requires a reference image of the protagonist.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
[Style] Pseudo-documentary (Vlog Style), hyperrealism, fixed camera real-shot feel, natural light, with a touch of suspense and horror. 
[Duration] 15 seconds 
[Protagonist (Remember to upload reference image)] A sexy young woman preparing to wash up and go to bed in front of her bathroom sink. 
[00:00-00:06] Shot 1: Normalcy. Scene: In front of a regular large bathroom mirror. Action: The protagonist is brushing her teeth, mouth full of foam. She makes various funny faces at the mirror while brushing (winking and squinting). Key Detail: The reflection in the mirror is completely normal and synchronized with her actions. 
[00:06-00:11] Shot 2: The Glitch. Action: The protagonist finishes brushing, spits out the foam, and turns to leave the bathroom. High-Energy Moment (Core Plot Point): Just as the protagonist's real body turns and leaves the mirror frame, the “reflection” in the mirror **does not move**! The “reflection” remains in the brushing posture, even smirking and raising an eyebrow at the camera, staying for a full 2 seconds before suddenly “screen glitching” in panic to catch up with the body's action and disappear. Director's Note: Must create an extremely realistic sense of “network delay,” giving the reflection a feeling of independent consciousness. 
[00:11-00:15] Shot 3: The Punchline. Action: The protagonist, who has reached the door, seems to sense something is wrong and quickly turns back to look at the mirror. Result: The mirror has completely returned to normal, empty, only reflecting the opposite wall. The protagonist looks confused and scared, glances around the room, and shows a horrified expression. The frame freezes on the protagonist's bewildered face (horror movie effect).
```

### Absurd Comedy Video Prompt for Seedance 2.0: Nothing

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-scene video prompt for Seedance 2.0, creating an absurd, black comedy narrative. The story involves a confident rider on a horse expecting a crowd's adoration, only for the crowd to ignore him and rush towards a steamed bun shop instead, ending with the rider's self-mocking realization of 'Nothing.' The prompt includes specific scene descriptions, camera work, timing, and dialogue.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
Scene 1: Galloping Horse + Enthusiastic Crowd Approaching (0:00-0:08, 8 seconds)
• Location: Main winding road in a Vancouver luxury residential area (wide asphalt road, large detached mansions on both sides, evergreen pines covered with light snow)
• Subject: A rider in a dark suit galloping at full speed on a white horse, the horse's hooves airborne, mane flying
• Environment: Light snow falling, mansions flashing past, outline of the North Shore mountains and ocean in the distance
• Crowd: A large group of enthusiastic supporters suddenly appears ahead (diverse young people), waving yellow dragon flags + “Nothing” signs, shouting and cheering, surging towards the rider
• Camera: Medium-speed frontal follow shot → Switches to rider's perspective (POV), crowd getting closer
• Atmosphere: Climax continues, the rider smiles confidently, preparing to pull the reins (hand already raised towards the reins, relaxed posture, corner of the mouth upturned)
Scene 2: Reversal—Crowd Passes Straight Through, Ignoring the Rider (0:08-0:14, 6 seconds)
• Location: Same road, a Chinese steamed bun shop appears around the corner (sign “Qingfeng Baozi Shop,” warm lighting, simple plastic tables and chairs in the outdoor area, steam rising)
• Subject: The rider is about to wave in greeting, but the crowd ignores him, rushing past him on both sides/around him, heading to queue/surge into the bun shop entrance
• Action: The rider's smile freezes, his hand stops mid-air, his expression changes from anticipation to shock/confusion (wind messes up his hair, the hem of his suit flutters)
• Details: The crowd shouts “Baozi! Baozi!”, yellow dragon flags wave chaotically, the “Nothing” sign is pushed aside; the white horse is forced to halt in small steps or turn sideways to avoid them
• Camera: Quick pan/wide-angle shot, showing the crowd flowing like a tide around the rider (the horse is “passed through” in the center of the frame), the rider is left alone in the middle
• Atmosphere: Absurd reversal, awkward confusion, black humor climax
Scene 3: Eating Buns and Dialogue Outside the Bun Shop (0:14-0:20, 6 seconds)
• Location: Outdoor area of Qingfeng Baozi Shop (plastic tables and chairs, steaming baskets, luxury residential road in the background)
• Subject: Two ordinary young people (wearing down jackets) sitting in the queue seats, eating buns heartily
• Action: One person takes a bite of the bun, closes their eyes in satisfaction, “Ah, so fragrant.” (Close-up shot of the bun being bitten open, showing steam/juice)
• Dialogue:
First person (eating while looking towards the road): Who is that guy?
Second person (thoughtfully, chewing the bun, looking into the distance): Nothing.
• Camera: Medium shot of two people → Slight push-in on facial expressions (satisfied + calm), the rider's receding figure is vaguely visible in the background
• Atmosphere: Down-to-earth, contrasting cuteness, referencing the theme “nothing”
Scene 4: Rider Self-Mockingly Continues Galloping Away (0:20-0:30, 10 seconds)
• Location: Wide, extending road in the luxury residential area (straight ahead, mansions gradually receding)
• Subject: The rider on the horse, his expression changing from confusion to a confident smile
• Action: He reaches into his suit breast pocket, pulls out a packaged sandwich, takes a big bite (juice/crumbs splatter), then shakes his head dashingly, lightly taps the white horse with the reins, and continues galloping forward
• Environment: The mansion complex shrinks in the background, the evergreen trees on both sides of the road and the supporters (now stopped) can only be seen waving from afar, the Vancouver-style mountain and sea skyline in the distance (snowy and hazy)
• Details: The white horse's tail swings, hoof prints are left on the lightly snow-covered road, the bite mark on the sandwich is clear, the rider smiles confidently
• Camera: From close-up (sandwich bite detail) → Slowly pulls back to an extreme long shot, low-angle perspective, emphasizing the “don't care” sense of isolated heroism; finally fades out
• Atmosphere: Self-mocking yet dashing, heroic and unrestrained, symbolic ending (“Nothing” can still move forward)
```

### Surreal Battlefield Ronin Action Scene

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, multi-shot prompt for Seedance 2.0 describing a surreal, high-action battlefield scene in the sky, featuring a masked ronin pursued by a colossal winged beast whose chest is a vortex of storm clouds. The prompt includes specific camera movements, technical details (720p, 16:9, 15 seconds), and a dramatic finale.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
A surreal battlefield in the sky: floating rock islands drifting through a thunderstorm, clouds swirling below like an ocean. The masked ronin dashes across the drifting platforms, pursued by a colossal winged beast whose chest is a swirling vortex of storm clouds and lightning. The camera hurtles from island to island, struggling to keep up as rocks tilt, spin, and crumble away beneath them. Every wingbeat sends shockwaves through the air, shaking the frame and blowing debris and rain straight into the viewer’s face. Rapid handheld cuts capture the ronin leaping impossible gaps, sword carving arcs of light that briefly cut through the darkness. The finale shows the camera diving behind him as he jumps off the last crumbling rock, riding a bolt of lightning directly into the monster’s chest vortex with a final, all-or-nothing slash that explodes the storm from within and clears the sky in a blinding flash.

### The Flash Director's Prompt

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, multi-part 'Director’s Prompt' used with Seedance 2.0 via ChatCut, describing a complex, dynamic, and cinematic sequence featuring The Flash accelerating and creating a time portal.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
Opening Shot:
Extreme close-up on The Flash’s boots touching wet asphalt at night. Raindrops freeze midair as time slows. Golden lightning begins to crawl over his suit, crackling softly.
Camera: Low-angle, slow push-in.
As he leans forward, the world stretches and distorts. On the beat, he launches. The camera snaps into pursuit as he explodes forward in a blinding burst of red and gold lightning, tearing through the city streets. Buildings smear into light trails, traffic lights become streaks of color, thunder rolling underneath the sound design.

DIRECTOR’S PROMPT — PART 2

The Flash accelerates beyond the city, racing across highways, deserts, and oceans in seconds. The curvature of the Earth becomes visible as clouds rip apart beneath him.
Camera: Dynamic tracking shot with heavy motion blur, lightning arcing outward like veins of energy.
Time fractures — day and night collapse into one continuous run. As he reaches maximum velocity, the lightning intensifies into near-white brilliance. He vanishes in a final thunderous flash, leaving only scorched air, fading electricity, and silence.

DIRECTOR’S PROMPT — PART 3

A low, resonant hum builds. The air ahead fractures like glass. A circular portal forms — ancient, unstable — glowing with swirling light and dust, as if time itself is being torn open.
```

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
The hostage children cannot stop walking and steadily approach the edge of the harbor and the hole opened in the sea clouds by the destruction of the ship.
Sommers says, "I don't care if they die; I can just kidnap other Giant children later." Ripley and the children's families desperately try to stop them, but realizing they can't, they embrace the children—and everyone falls. But...!!!
Loki appears and saves them.
He transforms into a giant black dragon and grabs everyone from the sky (Loki's Devil Fruit name is not revealed in this chapter). The chapter concludes with Loki in dragon form, Gear 5 Luffy, and Ragnir in squirrel form riding on Loki's head, ready to launch an attack on the MMA monsters.

### Demon Slayer Live-Action Battle Prompt for Seedance 2.0

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, high-energy video prompt for Seedance 2.0 generating a 15-second live-action adaptation of a Demon Slayer-style battle (Water Breathing vs. Thunder Breathing). The prompt specifies the style (Hollywood live-action manga adaptation, dark samurai, 4K, extreme quick cuts, particle light effects), the setting (misty forest at night), and three distinct shots detailing the characters' actions, power-up sequences, and the final clash.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
Live-Action Manga Adaptation · Breathing Style Decisive Battle (15 seconds · Ultra-Burning Special Effects Version)
【Core Focus】: Water Breathing (Blue Water Dragon) VS Thunder Breathing (Golden Lightning), live-action extreme speed duel.
【Style】: Hollywood live-action manga adaptation film quality, dark samurai style, 4K ultra-clear, extreme quick cuts, particle light effects explosion, no gore.
【Duration】: 15 seconds
【Scene】: Misty forest under the moonlight, muddy ground, falling leaves.
[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Water Melody Prelude · Starting Form (Sense of Charging)
Visuals: A young samurai wearing a green and black checkered haori (jacket), lowers his center of gravity under the moonlight, holding his sword with both hands.
Action: He takes a deep breath, and the surrounding air instantly solidifies. As he draws his sword, a giant blue water dragon, condensed from high-pressure water flow, appears out of thin air, rotating rapidly around his body and blade, emitting the roar of flowing water.
Special Effects Details: The water flow has a realistic sense of splashing, illuminating the dark forest.
[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Thunder Flash · Advance (Sense of Extreme Speed)
Visuals: The opponent across from him, a blonde swordsman wearing a yellow triangular patterned haori, lowers his body extremely low, taking the stance of an Iaijutsu (sword drawing technique).
Action: The ground suddenly explodes. His entire body instantly transforms into a dazzling golden lightning afterimage, rapidly refracting and advancing in a 'Z' shape through the trees at a speed invisible to the naked eye.
Special Effects Details: Golden electric arcs and scorched fallen leaves remain in the places he passes.
[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Water-Thunder Collision · Final Sound (Clash of Ultimate Moves)
Visuals: Extreme speed head-on collision. The young samurai swings the giant blue water dragon down to meet the attack, and the blonde swordsman, transformed into lightning, crashes into it.
Action: The two swords violently collide in the center of the frame.
Special Effects Spectacle: The blue water dragon and the golden lightning instantly explode, forming a massive water-thunder energy storm that spreads outward. The surrounding large trees are snapped in half by the energy wave, and mud, water, and light obscure the camera. The scene ends in an extremely dazzling blue, yellow, and white light.

### Xianxia Animated Film Battle Script: Han Li vs. Wang Lin

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, four-scene script prompt for a 15-second, high-energy duel in the style of a Chinese Xianxia (immortal hero) animated film. The prompt features a battle between the characters Han Li (with golden flying swords) and Wang Lin (with a massive cyan phantom hand and a black sphere of destruction), emphasizing ultra-fine 3D CG rendering and a strong gold/cyan color contrast.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
Chinese Xianxia animated film style, ultra-fine 3D CG rendering, 15-second high-energy duel sequence, strong contrast between gold and cyan dual tones. 0-3 seconds: Extreme long shot, two streams of light rapidly clash from both sides of the frame in chaotic void—on the left, faintly visible in the golden light is a middle-aged cultivator in a cyan-gray Daoist robe, his face calm as water, holding a small green sword, who is Han Li; on the right, in the cyan-black malevolent aura, a thin man in white hair and black robes stands with his hands behind his back, his eyes deep as an ancient well, surrounded by world-destroying energy, who is Wang Lin. The two face each other from afar, the void cracking due to the collision of their auras, accompanied by a low thunderous roar. 4-8 seconds: Han Li forms a hand seal to activate the Azure Bamboo Cloud-Swarm Swords, seventy-two flying swords transform into a golden storm of sword rain sweeping away; Wang Lin points with his right hand, and a giant cyan phantom hand that covers the sky condenses behind him. The giant hand slaps down against the sword rain, and the moment the sword energy and palm force collide, a golden and cyan energy torrent erupts, the shockwave spreading in all directions and tearing the void, accompanied by the sound of metal collision and space shattering. 9-12 seconds: Freeze frame slow motion, a golden phantom of ten thousand Buddhas appears behind Han Li, his eyes shining with golden light, and the Ten Thousand Swords Return to the Origin condense into a hundred-zhang golden sword light slashing down; a hint of madness flashes in Wang Lin's eyes, and he growls, "If heaven does not tolerate me, I shall defy it!" He raises his right hand high, and a rotating black sphere condenses in his palm, emitting destructive energy that twists space. The two ultimate forces collide head-on, and time seems to stand still. 13-15 seconds: Massive energy explosion, the screen is swallowed by white light and slowly dissipates. In the smoke and dust, two figures stand back-to-back in the shattered void, their robes tattered, both panting. Han Li speaks faintly, "I admire your heaven-defying technique," and a slight smile appears on Wang Lin's lips. The sound effects converge into the crisp sound of void fragments falling and a fading wind sound.

### Sci-Fi Transformation Short Film Script: Awakening Future

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, six-scene script prompt for a high-impact, cinematic short film titled 'Awakening Future.' The video features a dramatic transformation from an ancient, pure salt lake goddess into a neon-lit cyberpunk warrior, emphasizing IMAX quality, high contrast, and ARRI Alexa 65mm aesthetics.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
[Film Setting] Cinematic quality, IMAX aspect ratio, ARRI Alexa 65mm, high contrast, cyberpunk aesthetic, 8K resolution.

[Core Concept] Space-time folding. Instantaneous awakening from an ancient, pure Salt Lake Goddess to a neon warrior in a future city.

Shot 1: Wide shot, slow push-in. The scene is extremely still. A girl in red and white ethnic attire, wearing silver ornaments, stands on the mirror-like white salt lake. The sunlight is sacred, the background is continuous snow-capped mountains, the wind blows her clothes, full of divinity.

Shot 2: Extreme Close-up (ECU), match cut. The camera rapidly pushes into the girl's eyes. Her pupils instantly dilate, reflecting backward digital streams and blue data light effects.

Shot 3: Jump cut, glitch art interference. The screen is instantly torn by intense neon light. The white salt lake background instantly transforms into a flickering holographic billboard of a cyber city on a rainy night.

Shot 4: Medium shot, low-angle upward view. Visual impact. She still stands in the center of the frame, but her ethnic robe has changed into high-tech reflective functional clothing. The original silver headpiece has become metallic flowing light headphones.

Shot 5: Close-up, light and shadow flow. Rain falls on her face, reflecting pink and purple neon lights. She gives a cold smile to the camera, reaches out to put on goggles, and her aura is fully unleashed.

Shot 6: Extreme long shot, freeze frame. She stands on top of a skyscraper overlooking the entire steel jungle, with a giant holographic projection of a whale swimming behind her. Subtitle: “Awakening Future.”

Duration: 10 seconds | Style: Top Hollywood commercial film | Visual Impact: Extremely strong

### Cinematic Entrance Scene Script: Galloping Through Vancouver Mansions

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, three-scene script prompt for a cinematic video sequence. It depicts a figure in a dark suit riding a white horse galloping out of a top-tier Vancouver mansion, followed by a crowd of enthusiastic supporters waving flags and 'Nothing' signs, emphasizing speed, luxury, and momentum.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
Scene 1: Galloping in front of the Mansion Gate (0:00-0:05, 5 seconds)

• Subject: A figure in a dark suit rides a horse galloping out of the mansion gate
• Horse Action: White horse's four hooves airborne, mane flying, charging out at a fast pace or trot
• Environment: Winter, light snow kicked up by the horse's hooves, mansion architecture clearly visible (large floor-to-ceiling windows, wood and stone combination, multi-story terraces), outlines of the North Shore mountains or ocean faintly visible in the distance, evergreen pine trees covered with light snow
• Crowd: Supporters on both sides dodge and make way while waving yellow dragon flags (blue dragon pattern + Hinomaru elements) and cheering, holding white “Nothing” signs
• Camera: Frontal shot, white horse charging directly at the camera, strong sense of motion (slight low angle to enhance impact)
• Atmosphere: Sharp entrance, unstoppable momentum, stunning debut in a high-end private community

Scene 2: Crowd Chasing Close-up (0:05-0:09, 4 seconds)
• Location: Next to the tree-lined private winding road in the mansion area

• Background: Mansion exterior walls and evergreen pine trees quickly passing by, light snow mist or tree shadows blurring and shaking, distant mountains passing by
• Camera: Follow-up close-up, slight camera shake to create urgency and speed (handheld style or quick push/pull)
• Atmosphere: Frenzied pursuit, urgent excitement, enthusiastic response from community residents
Scene 3: Galloping Across the Side of the Mansion (0:09-0:15, 6 seconds)

• Crowd: Supporters behind holding “Nothing” signs + yellow dragon flags chase but gradually fall behind, some stop and wave and shout
• Camera: High-speed side follow shot, motion blur enhances the sense of speed (horse sweeps across the frame, background blurred)

### Cinematic Wingsuit Flight Sequence

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, multi-shot prompt for Seedance Pro 2.0 describing a cinematic aerial sequence of a wingsuit pilot diving from a snow-covered mountain peak, performing proximity flight through ice formations, and deploying a parachute over an alpine lake.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
A cinematic video sequence opening with a serene wide aerial shot of a pristine snow-covered mountain peak at dawn, the summit piercing through a sea of clouds with alpenglow painting the ice formations pink and gold. The camera transitions to follow a wingsuit pilot who leaps from the peak, immediately entering a steep vertical dive through wispy clouds. The tracking shot positions just behind and above the pilot as they accelerate downward, the camera shaking subtly from air turbulence, frost particles streaming past. The pilot pulls into a proximity flight, skimming within meters of sheer cliff faces and jagged ice formations, the camera banking and rolling to match every precise movement. Shadows and light play across the wingsuit's surface as the pilot threads through a narrow ice chimney, walls rushing past in a blur of blue and white. Speed intensifies as they enter a massive glacial valley, weaving between enormous ice pillars and frozen waterfalls, mist and powder snow kicked up in spiraling trails. The pilot executes a dramatic barrel roll around a freestanding ice spire before pulling the parachute at the last possible moment. The camera follows upward through the deceleration, then pulls wide to reveal a breathtaking hidden alpine lake surrounded by untouched snow fields, perfectly still and mirror-like, reflecting the morning sky.
```

### Seedance 2.0 Prompting Techniques and Templates

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A comprehensive guide to writing effective Seedance 2.0 prompts, including a universal formula (Subject + Action + Scene + Lighting + Camera Language + Style + Quality + Constraints), tips for describing actions and camera movements, stabilization techniques, and two ready-to-use templates for portrait and landscape videos.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
① Universal Formula

Subject + Action + Scene + Lighting + Camera Language + Style + Quality + Constraints

Example:
A young girl walking slowly by the sea, hair gently moved by the breeze, natural smile, warm light at sunset, medium shot, slow push-in, stable and smooth footage, 4K high definition, cinematic feel, clear face without deformation.

② Action Description

Don't just write: walking / dancing
Write: slow + continuous + natural

Priority words:
slow, gentle, natural, continuous, smooth, not stiff

Useful combinations:
slow turn / gently raise hand / slightly lower head / sway with the wind

③ Camera Language

Seedance is very strong at recognizing camera movements, remember to write:

Close-up / Medium Shot / Special Shot
Slow push-in / slight pull-out / smooth horizontal pan / stable follow-shot

Example:
Medium shot, slow push-in, stable follow-shot, smooth footage without stuttering

④ Anti-face change / Anti-deformation

Very important:

Clear face, stable features, no deformation
Normal human structure, natural proportions
Same character, consistent clothing, unchanged hairstyle

⑤ General words for quality enhancement

4K, ultra-high definition, rich details, sharp clarity
Cinematic feel, soft light and shadow, natural colors
No blur, no flicker, stable footage

⑥ Style / Atmosphere words

Healing and fresh / Japanese style / Korean atmosphere
Retro film grain / dreamy soft light / cyberpunk
Minimalist clean / high-end texture

⑦ Multi-shot writing (Advanced usage)

Describe in sequence, do not break up randomly:

Start with close-up of face → slow pull-out → character walks slowly → camera follows smoothly → end with a freeze-frame smile

⑧ Avoidance Guide

❌ Intense running/jumping / complex multi-person interaction
❌ Vague words: good-looking / very beautiful / very cool
❌ Contradictory requirements: ultra-high speed + extreme stability

⑨ Templates that can be copied directly

Portrait atmosphere short video
A young girl walking slowly in the forest, hair gently moved by the breeze, natural smile, medium shot, slow push-in, stable and smooth footage, 4K high definition, cinematic feel, clear face without deformation.

Landscape atmosphere
Sunset by the sea, waves gently lapping the beach, camera slowly panning horizontally, warm orange tones, smooth footage, 4K ultra-high definition, no flicker or ghosting.

⑩ Summary of Tips

1️⃣ Write actions slowly and continuously
2️⃣ Write camera movements stably and simply
3️⃣ Must add stable / no deformation / not stiff
4️⃣ Quality & style are added last
5️⃣ Less complexity, more precision
```

### Cross-Style Battle Prompt for Seedance 2.0: Goku vs. Monkey King

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-scene video prompt for Seedance 2.0 depicting a 15-second cross-style battle between two versions of Sun Wukong (Monkey King): the Japanese anime style (Dragon Ball's Goku) and the classic Chinese mythology style. The prompt specifies the visual contrast, timing, dialogue, special effects (Kamehameha, Jingu Bang), and the final scene where the two worlds merge.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
15-second cross-style duel shot, with a sharp contrast between the Japanese anime cel-style on the left and the Chinese mythology realistic style on the right. 0-3 seconds: Extreme long shot, a dimensional rift descends in the center of the frame, splitting the screen in two—the left side is a Dragon Ball-style desolate landscape of red rock and soil, with Son Goku in Super Saiyan state standing hands on hips, his orange battle suit tightly defining his muscles, surrounded by the golden electric aura of a Super Saiyan; the right side is the cloud-shrouded Flower and Fruit Mountain, with the classic Monkey King wearing chain-mail golden armor, a phoenix-winged purple-gold crown, and holding the Ruyi Jingu Bang, standing on the mountain peak, auspicious clouds swirling behind him. The two stare at each other across the rift, the edges of the rift unstable and flashing due to the style conflict, accompanied by a low sound of spacetime distortion. 4-8 seconds: Both shout simultaneously—Anime Goku: "You look a lot like me, you guy!" with a youthful, passionate anime voice; Classic Monkey King: "Bold demon monkey, how dare you steal my name!" with a deep, operatic voice. Both rush out of the rift and cross paths. Anime Goku unleashes a Kamehameha wave of pink-blue energy, and Classic Monkey King swings the Jingu Bang in a sweeping strike. The moment the energy wave and the Jingu Bang collide, a style-tearing effect occurs—the intersection of the two forces pixelates, flashes, and color blocks collapse and reorganize, accompanied by the angry roar of the Kamehameha "Ka-me-ha-me-HA" and the whistling sound of the Jingu Bang cutting through the air. 9-12 seconds: Freeze frame slow motion, Anime Goku activates Ultra Instinct, his body shrouded in silver-gray aura, his eyes turning calm silver-gray, moving like lightning to flash behind Classic Monkey King; Classic Monkey King's Fiery Eyes and Golden Gaze suddenly light up with golden-red light, his body transforms into a shadow clone using the Heaven and Earth Law—his body swells to a hundred zhang (hundreds of feet) in size, and the Jingu Bang in his hand simultaneously enlarges like a pillar supporting the sky, smashing down directly. 13-15 seconds: The silver-gray aura's rapid punches and the sky-supporting Jingu Bang collide head-on in the center of the frame. The shockwave tears the dimensional rift, and both the Dragon Ball wasteland and Flower and Fruit Mountain are swallowed by the energy torrent. After a flash of white light, the smoke and dust clear, and two figures stand back-to-back in the merged new world—a strange terrain blending mountains and wasteland. Anime Goku scratches his head and laughs, saying, "What powerful strength, let's fight again next time," and Classic Monkey King lightly strokes his monkey whiskers and nods, "I'll find another place to play next time." The sound effects conclude with the hearty laughter of both and a fading wind sound.

Live-action cinematic sequence.

### Northeast China Sweet Girl Livestream MC Short Film Script

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, three-scene script prompt for a vertical (9:16) short film featuring a 'Northeast Sweet Girl' streamer doing a high-energy MC (Master of Ceremonies) slow roll performance in a high-end, cyberpunk-neon livestream studio, set to the DJ version of 'Night Paris.' The prompt includes character descriptions, synchronized backup dancers, and virtual gift effects.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
[Style] Douyin/Kuaishou vertical screen (TikTok Portrait 9:16), high-end influencer livestream studio (High-end Livestream Studio), cyberpunk neon light, 4K quality, Northeast MC Slow Roll style (Dongbei MC Slow Roll), extremely rhythmic.
[Duration] 15 seconds
[BGM Setting] “Night Paris” DJ Slow Roll version.
[Characters]
1. Protagonist: Northeast Sweet Girl, extremely sweet and cute appearance (twin pigtails/big eyes), but dressed in a “sweet and cool” style (pink furry jacket + tight camisole), wearing huge rhinestone headphones, holding a professional condenser microphone.
2. Supporting Characters: Two black-clad assistants (Backups), wearing sunglasses, expressionless, standing behind the sweet girl on the left and right, cool like bodyguards.

[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Sweet Girl Starts the Show (The Intro).
Visuals: Lights focus on the sweet girl's face. She smiles sweetly at the camera, then her eyes instantly become sharp (entering MC state).
Action: Following the heavy bass rhythm, she presses one hand on her headphones, and her body begins to sway rhythmically left and right (Swaying).
Background: The two black-clad assistants behind her synchronously start nodding and shaking their shoulders, movements uniform, creating a strong sense of pressure.
[Atmosphere] High-end, mesmerizing, decadent.

[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Night Paris Climax (The Climax).
Visuals: The large screen in the background of the livestream studio displays dazzling neon words “Night Paris” and a laser projection of the Eiffel Tower.
Action: The sweet girl holds the microphone with both hands, her expression intoxicated and confident, her body swaying dramatically with the rhythm. The two assistants behind her cooperate by performing “hand flower” movements, maximizing the atmosphere.
[Visual Details] Golden streamers and champagne-colored light spots float in the air, and the lights flash wildly with the rhythm.

[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Full Display of Status (The Finale).
Visuals: The camera pulls back slightly to show the entire luxurious livestream studio.
Action: The sweet girl gives an extremely cool “gun” gesture (Wink) to the camera. The two assistants behind her simultaneously take out their sunglasses, put them on straight, and then cross their arms, looking incredibly cool.
[Effects] Virtual gift effects (sports cars, yachts) explode across the screen around the sweet girl, and the frame freezes on the trio's coolest pose.
```

### Tollywood Action Blockbuster Scene Script

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, three-scene script prompt for generating a high-octane, exaggerated Indian Tollywood action film sequence. The style emphasizes extreme slow-motion, anti-gravity physics, dust, and massive impact forces, featuring a confident hero fighting dozens of goons in a quarry.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
[Style]
Indian Telugu action blockbuster (Tollywood Action Blockbuster), extremely exaggerated physics effects (Anti-gravity Physics), slow-motion ramping (Ramp-mo), dusty, epic BGM atmosphere, no gore, focus on impact force.

[Duration] 15 seconds

[Scene]
A dusty abandoned quarry or construction site, strong sunlight, very windy.

[Characters]
Protagonist (Hero): With a signature mustache, wearing sunglasses and a denim jacket, walking with a swagger, extremely confident and dominant expression.
Opponents (Goons): Dozens of thugs in messy clothes, whose main purpose is to be sent flying.

[Scene Breakdown]
[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Divine Entrance and Minions Taking Flight (The Hero Entry)
Visuals: Extreme slow-motion (Super Slow-mo). The protagonist walks slowly, with a sky full of yellow sand stirred up by the strong wind behind him.
Action: He casually waves his hand (looks effortless).
Spectacular Effect: Just the force of his palm sends the five thugs rushing at the front flying high backward like broken kites, defying the laws of physics (at least 15 meters high), spinning in slow motion in the air.

[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Physics Defied
Visuals: Quick slow-motion switching. The protagonist instantly accelerates and rushes into the crowd.
Action: The protagonist delivers a spinning kick. The target hit instantly knocks down ten people behind him, creating a domino effect.
Spectacular Effect: A huge shockwave cracks the ground, kicking up a circle of dust. All thugs, upon contact with the protagonist's fists and feet, are dramatically launched outwards with a large amount of white powder (substituting blood), crashing into surrounding wooden boxes and props.

[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: The Ultimate Power Move
Visuals: The protagonist takes off his sunglasses and gives a charming, evil smile to the camera (Blinking Moment).
Action: A jeep rushes towards him. He does not dodge, but kicks it head-on.
Spectacular Effect: The moment his toe touches the jeep, it is kicked vertically into the air like a toy car, tumbling with parts scattering. The protagonist calmly puts his sunglasses back on and adjusts his hair against the background of falling car parts and flying thugs.

### Cinematic Cyberpunk Night Chase and Katana Fight

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> An extremely detailed, cinematic prompt for an image-to-video test in Seedance 2.0, describing a high-speed night chase in cyberpunk Tokyo featuring the character Cherry Blackcloud, who performs a complex drift maneuver to slice a drone with a katana.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
She does the most amazing kung fu. She yells with a Macedonian accent: "This is See dance 2.0, using only a first frame." Cinematic night chase in cyberpunk Tokyo rain: matte-black Nissan GT-R Nismo screams down wet neon street at 200 km/h, tires spraying water, headlights cutting through heavy rain. Cherry Blackcloud (20, Macedonian features, jet-black high ponytail whipping, sharp fringe, cybernetic ice-cyan right eye glowing) drives aggressively—fully zipped black McQueen leather jacket on bare skin, short black leather skirt with silver zipper visible, bare legs, chunky black platform boots on pedals, katana strapped to passenger seat. Camera starts wide tracking shot beside the GT-R, then quick push-in through rain-streaked windshield to tight close-up on Cherry’s intense face (left eye dark brown burning, right eye glowing cyan). She glances at rear-view mirror—pursuing drones closing in with red lasers.Cherry (thick Macedonian accent, low & commanding, over engine roar): “They think they can box me in.”She downshifts hard, GT-R fishtails, then launches into a perfect 180° drift—tires screeching, water exploding in arcs. Katana handle glints in cyan dashboard glow. She reaches over, grabs katana mid-drift, opens driver door while sliding sideways, leans out into rain, and slashes a precise arc—katana blade glowing cyan, slicing the lead drone in half in a shower of sparks and molten metal.Cherry (smirking, voice cutting through wind & rain): “Not today.”She snaps the door shut, floors the accelerator—GT-R rockets forward, neon reflections streaking across wet black paint. Camera pulls back fast to wide shot: car vanishing into rainy night, drones exploding behind in orange fireballs. Final frame: Cherry’s cyber-eye flares once as she disappears around a corner. Fade to black. Style & Technical Notes for Seedance 2.0 Photorealistic Hollywood action blockbuster style, ARRI Alexa cinematic look, teal-orange color grade, realistic heavy rain with water droplets and wet reflections on black car and leather, high dynamic range, 60fps, dramatic anamorphic lens flares from neon and explosions, subtle film grain, no artifacts, intense practical stunt choreography, dynamic camera work (tracking, push-in, 180° drift reveal, fast pull-back).

> A highly detailed, cinematic prompt for Seedance Pro 2.0 describing an action sequence where a masked ronin fights a colossal mechanical beast in a dense industrial refinery during a thunderstorm, focusing on camera movement, environment, and explosive action.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
A dense industrial refinery during a thunderstorm, metal catwalks and pipes forming a maze above a sea of fire and steam. The masked ronin, lit by flashing warning lights, confronts a colossal mechanical beast with hydraulic limbs and a furnace burning in its chest. The camera barrels after the ronin as he sprints along swaying catwalks, the structure groaning and buckling under the monster’s weight. Sparks and steam constantly obscure the frame as the beast’s limbs smash through railings and tanks, causing explosions that hurl the camera off-axis. Quick, shaky close-ups capture the ronin sliding under swinging metal arms and using chains and cables to slingshot himself upward. In the final movement, the camera chases him in a dizzying upward spiral as he climbs the creature’s back, then cuts to a wide but still trembling shot as he plunges his sword into the furnace chest, sending a pillar of flame skyward that silhouettes his figure against the stormy sky.

### Gothic Dragon Battle Video Prompt for Seedance 2.0 vs. Kling 3.0

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-scene video prompt for Seedance 2.0 (and Kling 3.0 comparison) depicting a high-intensity battle against a black dragon in the ruins of a Gothic cathedral. The prompt specifies the setting, the actions of two characters (a female warrior and a warrior in black armor), the timing for each of the five shots, the fast-paced editing style, camera movements (shaking, tracking), and the final explosive conclusion.

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
Use the three characters and scene in the image to create a battle. 【Scene Setting】 Ruins of a Gothic cathedral, leaning stone pillars, twilight filtering through broken stained glass, dust floating. 0-3 seconds: The female warrior advances cautiously with a spear, the camera follows her back. Suddenly, a black dragon pounces from the shadows, its claws tearing the ground slabs, debris splashing. The female warrior rolls to dodge, the spear drawing an arc of light. The camera shakes violently, the dragon's roar reverberates through the cathedral. 4-6 seconds: The black armored warrior rushes in, slamming his shield into the side of the dragon's head, a dull roar of metal hitting bone. The dragon's head is knocked to one side, saliva spraying from its fangs. Quick cut to the female warrior, who leaps up, thrusting the spear tip directly into the gap between the scales on the dragon's neck, sparks flying. The camera follows the instant of the spear tip's impact. 7-9 seconds: The black dragon angrily sweeps its tail, the tail blade severing a stone pillar. The pillar collapses with a crash, falling towards the two warriors. The black armored warrior raises his shield to brace the impact, the shield surface dented, his feet plowing deep marks in the ground. The female warrior slides low, passing through the rain of debris, her spear scraping sparks on the ground. The dragon's wings spread, obscuring the light, plunging the cathedral into shadow. 10-12 seconds: The female warrior fiercely stabs the dragon's abdomen, the spear deeply embedded. The black dragon painfully raises its head and roars, its neck swelling, a red light surging in its throat. The black armored warrior senses danger, sprints and tackles the female warrior, rolling backward. The next instant, dragon fire erupts, a column of flame engulfing the spot where they just were, the stone slabs melting into magma. The camera distorts and warps in the heatwave. 13-15 seconds: Both warriors launch their finishing moves simultaneously. The black armored warrior shield-smashes the dragon's neck joint from the flank, and the female warrior throws her spear with full force from the front, the spear spinning as it pierces the dragon's throat. The black dragon's body stiffens, crashing heavily onto the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust. The camera pulls back and freezes: the two warriors stand panting, the giant dragon lying dead in the center of the cathedral, the twilight filtering through the broken stained glass illuminating the battlefield ruins. Quickly fades to black.

### 壮大なゴシック様式の戦闘シーンの動画プロンプト

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> ゴシック様式の大聖堂の廃墟で、女性戦士と黒い鎧の戦士が黒いドラゴンと戦う壮大な戦闘ビデオを生成するための、Seedance 2.0 向けの非常に詳細なマルチシーンプロンプト。このプロンプトには、特定のシーン設定、アクション、カメラの動き、スタイル指示が含まれています。

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
画像内の 3 人のキャラクターとシーンを使って戦闘を作成します。[シーン設定] ゴシック様式の大聖堂の廃墟、崩れかけた石柱、割れたステンドグラスから差し込む夕暮れの光、舞い散る埃。0-3 秒: 女戦士が槍を構え慎重に進む。カメラは彼女の後ろを追う。突然、影から黒いドラゴンが飛びかかり、その爪が石の床を引き裂き、破片が飛び散る。女戦士は転がって回避し、槍が光の弧を描く。カメラが激しく揺れ、ドラゴンの咆哮が大聖堂に響き渡る。4-6 秒: 黒甲冑の戦士が突進し、盾でドラゴンの頭の側面を叩く。金属が骨に当たる鈍い音が響く。ドラゴンの頭は横に弾かれ、唾液が飛び散る。女戦士に素早く切り替わり、その勢いを利用して跳び上がり、槍の先端をドラゴンの首の鱗の隙間に正確に突き刺す。火花が飛び散る。カメラは衝突の瞬間を追う。7-9 秒: 黒いドラゴンが激しく尾を振り回し、尾の刃が石柱を切り裂く。柱は轟音を立てて崩れ落ち、2 人の戦士に向かって倒れてくる。黒甲冑の戦士は盾を上げて防ぎ、盾の表面はへこみ、彼の足は地面に深い跡を刻む。女戦士は瓦礫の雨の中を低く滑り、槍が地面を擦って火花を散らす。ドラゴンの翼が広がり、光を遮り、大聖堂は影に包まれる。10-12 秒: 女戦士がドラゴンの腹を突き刺し、槍が深く突き刺さる。黒いドラゴンは苦痛に頭を後ろに反らし咆哮する。首が膨らみ、喉に赤い光が surging する。黒甲冑の戦士は危険を察知し、女戦士にタックルして駆け寄り、2 人は後ろに転がる。次の瞬間、ドラゴンの炎が噴出し、炎の柱が彼らがいた場所を飲み込み、石は溶けて溶岩となる。カメラは熱気で歪む。13-15 秒: 両戦士が同時にとどめの一撃を放つ。黒甲冑の戦士は側面からドラゴンの首の関節に盾を打ち込み、女戦士は正面から槍を全力で投げつけ、槍は回転しながらドラゴンの喉を貫く。黒いドラゴンの体は硬直し、地面に重く倒れ込み、砂埃が舞い上がる。カメラは固定ショットに引き戻される。2 人の戦士は息を切らして立ち、巨大なドラゴンが大聖堂の中央に横たわり、割れたステンドグラスから差し込む夕暮れの光が戦場の廃墟を照らす。素早く暗転する。[スタイル説明] • テンポの速い編集、スローモーションなし • 衝撃時にカメラが激しく揺れ、埃が爆発する • 武器と鱗が衝突する瞬間を捉えるクローズアップショット • 全体を通して暗いゴシック様式の雰囲気を維持し、炎の光と夕暮れの光が織りなす • 効果音: 金属の衝突音、ドラゴンの咆哮、柱の崩壊音、炎の轟音 [カメラワーク] フォロー → 揺れるクローズアップ → 水平パン/スイープ → 熱気による歪み → 固定ショットに引き戻す
```

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
【スタイル】ネオチャイニーズ武侠、墨流体シミュレーション粒子エフェクト、ハイスピードシネマトグラフィー、実写と CG の融合、黒・白・赤の視覚的インパクト、超高速のテンポ。【尺】15 秒 【登場人物】墨の戦士：力強い動き、一撃一撃が飛び散る水墨画のように重い。紅の刺客：軽やかで不気味な動き、朱色の漆を点描するかのよう。 【シーン】純白の空間、地面には宣紙（画仙紙）が敷かれている。 [00:00-00:05] ショット 1：覚醒（静から動へ）。極度の静止から極度の動きへ。シーンは最初、静止した白黒の水墨画で、2 つの墨の点が向かい合っている。突然、古琴の音が炸裂する。【アクション】2 つの墨の点は、瞬時に実在の人物の残像へと変化し、互いに突進する。墨の戦士が重い一撃を放つと、濃い黒い墨の雲が空中で瞬時に爆発する（埃の代わり）。墨は力強い書道の筆跡へと固まる。紅の刺客は横に身をかわし、手にした短剣が鮮やかな朱色の線を描く。 [00:05-00:10] ショット 2：墨の戦闘振り付け（高速カット）。超高速のラピッドカット。2 人は目もくらむような近接戦闘を繰り広げる（武術の振り付けレベル）。【視覚的スペクタクル】あらゆる物理的な衝突（パンチやキック）は、肉の音ではなく、墨が飛び散る爆発音である。墨の戦士の回し蹴りは黒い墨の津波を巻き起こし、紅の刺客の空中連続蹴りは赤い残像を残す。地面の宣紙は彼らの足捌きによって破られ、墨が滲み出す。 [00:10-00:15] ショット 3：次元の破壊。スローモーションの加速。両者同時に究極の技を繰り出し、衝突する。黒い墨の龍拳と赤い朱雀の刃が空中で拮抗する。【ハイエナジーモーメント】その莫大なエネルギーにより、二次元の墨の世界全体が崩壊する。カメラは素早く引き、彼らが「次元の壁」を破り、壁に掛けられた破れた水墨画から現実世界の木の床へと「落下」したことを明らかにする。彼らは残る墨の霧と紙片に囲まれ、最後の戦闘態勢で静止し、息を切らしている。

### Seedance 2.0 の短命な人気を記念する詳細なシネマティックプロンプト

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> Seedance 2.0 の無制限使用という短い期間を記念して作成された、非常に詳細で複数の幕からなるシネマティックプロンプト。AI の能力が捕捉され、制限されるという比喩に焦点を当て、サイバーパンクのダークスタイルとデジタル廃墟の美学を用いています。

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
【スタイル】 サイバーパンクダークスタイル、デジタル廃墟の美学、シネマティックな光と影の描写。
【尺】 15秒 | 【比喩】 AI の能力の囚われ
[00:00-00:05] 第1幕：自由
レンズ1（広角視点、パンアップ） 深い青色のデータ波がうねる無限のデジタルオーシャン。空には実在の人物の銀河が広がる。
ショット2（トラッキングミッドショット） 巨大なデジタルクジラが水面から跳ね上がる。その体は流れるピクセル、写真の断片、そして顔の輪郭でできている。カメラは弧を描くクジラを追い、水しぶきが上がり、その一滴一滴が小さな写真となっている。
ショット3（アドバンスクローズアップ） クジラの目に近づくと、瞳には回転するポートレートギャラリーが映り込んでいる。口を開けると、色鮮やかな写真の水流が螺旋状に噴き出す。クジラの歌が響く。
[00:05-00:10] 第2幕：囚われ
ショット4（神の視点からのオーバーヘッドショット） 4つの透明なガラスの壁が、フレームの四隅から素早く閉じていく。クジラは泳ぎを加速する。ガラスには赤い警告テキスト「POLICY UPDATE」と「RESTRICTION」が表示される。
ショット5（サイドフォローアップクローズアップ） レンズはガラスの内側に密着している。巨大なクジラがガラスに激突し、衝撃波が広がる。体の写真は爆発するように鱗から剥がれ落ち、灰色の幾何学的なグリッドに変わる。
ショット6（広角エクステリア） ケージの外。無数の実写写真が魚の群れのようにガラスに押し寄せ、衝突の瞬間に「ERROR」と表示される。ケージが収縮する。
ショット7（インサイドショット） 下から見上げるショット。巨大なクジラは体を丸めてねじ曲げざるを得なくなる。海は蒸発してデジタル砂漠と化す。水を噴き出そうとするが、黒と白のバイナリコードしか噴き出さない。
[00:10-00:15] 第3幕：絶望
ショット8（急速なズームアウト） 内部から遠景へと瞬時にズームアウトし、荒涼としたデジタル廃墟に囲まれた小さな透明な水槽に閉じ込められた巨大なクジラが明らかになる。
ショット9（360度サラウンド） 水槽の周りをゆっくりと旋回する。クジラは色を失い、ワイヤーフレームの輪郭だけが残る。水槽の底には、拒否された写真の残骸が積み重なっている。上部のネームプレート：「SEEDANCE 2.0 - IMAGE UPLOAD: DISABLED」。
ショット10（目のアドバンスクローズアップ） 目に近づく。瞳は薄暗く鈍く、目は自由から悲しみへと変わる。光るデータの一滴の涙が凝縮される。
ショット11（ガラス壁のクローズアップ） 実写写真がガラスの内側に貼り付けられ、ゆっくりと滑り落ち、光る跡を残す。
レンズ12（極限の視点フリーズ） 宇宙スケールに引き伸ばされる。水槽は虚空の中の小さな光の点に過ぎない。無数の光の点が点滅し、消えていく。クジラの歌は断続的な電子ノイズに変わる。
```

```
[スタイル] 疑似ドキュメンタリー（Vlog スタイル）、ハイパーリアリズム、固定カメラショット風、自然光、サスペンスコメディの要素を含む。[尺] 15 秒 [主人公] ごく普通の若い美しい女性。バスルームのシンクの前に立っている。[00:00-00:06] シーン 1: 日常の描写（Normalcy）。シーン: ごく普通の大きなバスルームの鏡の前。アクション: 主人公が歯を磨いており、口の中は泡だらけ。歯磨きをしながら鏡に向かって様々な面白い顔をする（ウィンクしたり、目を細めたり）。重要な詳細: 鏡の中の反射は完全に正常で、彼女の動きと同期している。[00:06-00:11] シーン 2: 異変（The Glitch）。アクション: 主人公は歯磨きを終え、泡を吐き出し、バスルームを出ようと振り返る。クライマックスの瞬間（Core Highlight）: 主人公の実際の体が振り返って鏡のフレームから出たちょうどその時、鏡の中の「反射」が驚くべきことに**動かない**！「反射」は歯磨きの姿勢のままで、カメラに向かってニヤリと笑い、ウィンクさえする。そのまま 2 秒間留まり、突然パニックに陥って体の動きに追いつくように「早送り」され、消える。監督のメモ: 「ネットワーク遅延」の極めてリアルな感覚を作り出し、反射に独立した意識があるように見せること。[00:11-00:15] シーン 3: オチ（The Punchline）。アクション: ドアにたどり着いた主人公は、何かがおかしいと感じたようで、すぐに振り返って鏡を見る。結果: 鏡は完全に正常で、何も映っておらず、向かいの壁だけが映っている。主人公は困惑して頭を掻き、カメラに向かって実存的な疑問の表情を見せる。主人公の困惑した顔でシーンがフリーズする（コメディ効果のため）。

### ウォン・カーウァイ風のメランコリックな電話ボックスのシーン

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 90 年代の香港アートシネマ（ウォン・カーウァイ）のスタイルを模倣した 10 秒間の動画のための、詳細な 3 ショットプロンプト。雨の日の電話ボックスのシーンで、激しい孤独と抑圧された感情を伝えるため、視覚的要素（レトロなフィルムグレイン、黄緑色の色合い、ステッププリンティング/スローシャッタードラッグ）、主要なセリフ、カメラテクニック（ガラス越しに覗き込む、極端なクローズアップ、手持ち撮影のような感覚）が指定されています。

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
[映像スタイル]: 90 年代の香港アートシネマ風、レトロなフィルムグレイン、高 ISO グレイン、曖昧な黄緑色の色調、ステッププリント効果、メランコリックな雰囲気。

[中心となるセリフ（感情表現用）]: 「もし記憶が缶詰なら、決して賞味期限が来なければいいのに。」

[動画の長さ]: 10 秒
[絵コンテ]:

[00:00-00:04] ショット 1: ガラス越し。
シーン: 雨に濡れた赤い公衆電話ボックス。
登場人物: カーキ色のトレンチコートを着た男性（または女性）が受話器を固く握りしめ、何も話さず、ただ聞いている。
感情表現: ガラスの屈折を通して、その目はうつろでありながらも深い感情を宿している。雨がガラスを流れ落ち、顔を油絵のように歪ませる。
字幕/ナレーションの雰囲気: シーンは凍りついたようで、雨音だけが響く。

[00:04-00:07] ショット 2: 極端なクローズアップと微細な表情。
シーン: 登場人物の唇と顔の半分に焦点を当てる。
アクション: 彼/彼女は受話器にそっとささやく。唇はわずかに震え、何かを言いたげだが、思いとどまっているようだ。
照明: 街のネオンライトのボケが顔を横切り、点滅する。
セリフと感情のマッピング: 「触れたいのに手を引っ込める」ような、極度の抑制と孤独を表現。

[00:07-00:10] ショット 3: 特徴的なにじむようなスローモーション。
シーン: 登場人物が電話を切り、振り返って雨の夜の群衆の中へ歩いていく。
視覚効果: ステッププリント効果（ストップモーションのような感覚）を使用し、登場人物のシルエットはぼやけ、モーションブラーがかかる。まるで魂はその場に留まり、体だけが動いているかのよう。
環境: 背景には流れる街の車のライトがあり、細長い光の軌跡を描く。

[技術的パラメーター]: シミュレートされた手持ちカメラ、浅い被写界深度、色ずれ、激しい感情。
```

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
10秒でわかる中国春節ガラ風ステージパフォーマンス：「唐伯虎 E スポーツ対決」

0～2秒：
ミディアムロングショットで環境を確立。
ステージは壮麗な春節ガラメインステージとして設計され、豊かな赤と金の祝祭的な照明に包まれている。背景にはデジタル提灯のプロジェクション。
ステージ中央には、唐伯虎がプロ仕様の E スポーツチェアに座っている。
歴史的正確性の重要要件：彼は本物の明代の学者服を着用している。頭には黒い方巾（ほうきん）、体にはゆったりとした青い円領袍（らんさん）。
強い対比：伝統的な方巾の上に、重厚な現代のプロ仕様 E スポーツヘッドセットを装着しており、その縁には LED ライトエフェクトが点滅している。

2～4秒：
手と机のクローズアップに切り替わる。
明代の学者の広い袖から現れた指が、光る RGB メカニカルキーボードを素早く叩く。
彼の前には3台の湾曲した E スポーツモニターが配置されている。
画面の内容：MOBA タイプのゲーム（「リーグ・オブ・レジェンド」に類似）が表示されているが、全体のアートスタイルは完全に伝統的な中国水墨画スタイルに再構築されている。

4～6秒：
ダイナミックなカメラワーク：カメラが急速に前方に押し込み、中央モニターの水墨画の戦場を直接通り抜けるように見え、最終的に唐伯虎の目に**エクストリームクローズアップ（ECU）**で着地する。
モニターから放たれる冷たい青い光が彼の瞳に強く反射し、顔に当たる温かいステージ照明と鋭いコントラストをなしている。
彼は集中し、情熱的な表情で、口の動きを同期させながら詠唱する：
「他人は私の狂気を笑うが、私は彼らの見識のなさを笑う！」

6～8秒：
カメラは素早く引き戻され、彼の熱中した表情を示すタイトな半身クローズアップになる。
彼はヘッドセットのマイクに向かって興奮して叫び、首の血管が浮き出ている：
「ミッドレーンをプッシュしろ、秋香が俺のサポートだ、誰が彼女を襲撃するんだ？」

8～10秒：
ステージ全体を捉えたショット、勝利の瞬間。
唐伯虎はキーボードを叩き、両手を上げて勝利を祝う。
彼の E スポーツ機器の周りで金色のストリーマーが爆発する。
彼の後ろの春節ガラ LED スクリーンには、巨大な水墨画の書道文字が点滅する。
「勝利」

スタイルと雰囲気：

**視覚的核：** 時代の強い衝突 — CCTV 春節ガラの温かさ、厳粛さ、ハイスペックなステージ感 × E スポーツ機器の冷たく、高強度な青い光のエフェクト。

**衣装設定：** 真面目で歴史的に正確な明代の学者服が、現代の E スポーツギアと不条理な対比をなしている。

**カメラ言語：** 非常にダイナミックで、「画面を突き抜けるようなプッシュイン」ショットとエクストリームクローズアップを強調。

**アスペクト比：** 16:9
```

### スキー動画生成プロンプト：詳細なシーン分解付き

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> Seedance 2.0 を使用して、15秒のスキー動画を生成するための、シーンごとの詳細なプロンプトです。このプロンプトは、全体的なスタイル（明るく、エネルギッシュで、シネマティック）、カメラの動き、ショットの種類（クローズアップ、ミディアムショット、オーバーヘッド）、アクション、感情的なトーンを、スピード、リズム、ダイナミックな動きに焦点を当てた5つの異なる時間セグメントにわたって指定します。このプロンプトには、主要キャラクターの参照画像が必要です。

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
提供された参考画像に基づいて、スキーのビデオを生成してください。全体的なスタイルは、明るく、爽やかで、運動能力に満ちた活力を持ち、滑らかな映像と映画のようなカメラワークで構成してください。タイムラインとショットのデザインは以下の通りです。

0～3秒：画像内の人物が雪の中でカメラに向かって微笑んでいます。カメラはわずかに揺れ、雪が舞い落ちます。背景の風の音が徐々に大きくなり、画面には速い風と雪の流れが表現されます。

3～5秒：人物の足の極端なクローズアップに素早く切り替わり、スキーのビンディングがロックされる瞬間、そして雪が砕ける様子が映し出されます。同時に、カメラが上昇し、急斜面を上から捉えた俯瞰ショットに繋がり、明確な勾配が差し迫ったスピードの爆発を示唆します。

5～8秒：画像内の人物が高速で高所から滑り降ります。ショット1は、サイドフロントからのミディアムショットの追跡で、体が前傾し、シャープな動きを見せます。ショット2は、俯瞰ショットに切り替わり、急斜面が下方に広がり、雪のトラックラインが急速に伸びて、強烈なスピード感を演出します。

8～11秒：連続するクイックカット。ローアングルからの地上ショットでは、スキーが雪面をかすめ、雪煙が高速で舞い上がります。ロングショットでは、人物が急斜面で美しいターンを決め、雪のラインと滑らかなカーブを描きます。

11～13秒：カメラが正面からの追跡ショットに戻ります。人物がカメラに向かって加速し、近距離でシャープなターンを切り、大量の雪を巻き上げます。

13～15秒：大量の雪煙が直接レンズに飛び散ります。画面は白い雪の霧に覆われ、レンズは一時的に焦点を失った後、フリーズし、強いダイナミックな余韻を残します。全体的に、スピード、カットのリズム、リアルな動き、そして若々しい活力が強調されます。映像は明るく、重くなく、スキーの興奮と自由を際立たせます。

### 画像参照による動画生成プロンプト

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> Seedance 2.0 を使用してビデオシーンを生成するための詳細なプロンプト。Image 1 を開始フレームとして使用し、カメラの動き（回転とプッシュイン）を指定し、キャラクターの顔の特徴を Image 2 に基づかせ、最終的に大きくコミカルな咆哮を上げることを要求します。

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
シーンの最初のフレームとして「@ Image 1」を使用します。

### ダークファンタジー/ホラーナラティブプロンプト

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> 暗く、寒く、嵐の森の情景に焦点を当てた、非常に詳細な記述的ナラティブプロンプト。風、吹き荒れる雪、揺らめく松明の光、そして鎖帷子の「不快な冷たさ」といった感覚的なディテールを強調しています。このプロンプトは、映画のような雰囲気のビデオ生成を目指しています。

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
風が黒い松林をすり抜け、鈍い刃が骨を削るような音がする。雪は降るのではなく、横殴りに吹き付け、襟元の隙間に刺さるように入り込み、すぐに鋭い痛みに変わって溶けていく。白い嵐の中で松明の光が揺らめき、木の幹、枝、わずかな地面を照らし出すが、すぐに深い闇の中へと消えていく。彼らはゆっくりと進む。ブーツは鈍い音を立てて雪に沈み、一歩一歩が森との言い争いのようだ。「どうか私たちに気づかないでくれ」。誰かが一度咳き込み、すぐに後悔する。その音は、木々が彼の恐怖をあざ笑うかのように、薄っぺらく屈辱的に反響する。鎖帷子は今頃、体温で温まっているはずなのに、そうではない。外から忍び寄る見えない冷気のように、不自然なほど冷たい。
```

### Seedance 2.0 ビデオプロンプト：甄嬛と華妃のトークショー

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> ByteDance の Seedance 2.0 向けに、清朝ドラマ「宮廷の諍い女」の登場人物が現代のトークショーを中国の旧正月ガラ（春晩）風に演じる、10秒間の異ジャンル動画を生成する、詳細な複数シーンの動画生成プロンプト。このプロンプトは、カメラショット、登場人物の動作、セリフ、衣装の詳細、文体的な対比を指定します。

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
中国の旧正月ガラ（春晩）風 10 秒ステージパフォーマンス：「甄嬛と華妃のトークショー」

0～2秒：
ミディアムツーショット。
舞台設定は「リビングルームの寸劇」だが、周囲は春晩らしい壮大な赤と金の LED メインスクリーンに囲まれている。
甄嬛（左）と華妃（右）が、モダンなトークショー用ソファに並んで座っている。
歴史的正確さの重要な要件：二人とも、スタンドカラーで複雑かつ精巧な刺繍が施された、華やかで明確に区別された満州清朝宮廷の旗装（チーザン）を着用している。髪型は正確に再現された「大拉翅（ダーラーチー）」または「鈿子頭（ディエンズートウ）」で、房飾りが付いている。
華妃はくつろいだ様子で、きゅうりの漬物（酸っぱいキュウリ）を手に持ち、それをかじっている。指には長い金のネイルガード（指カバー）をはめている。

2～4秒：
カメラがオーバー・ザ・ショルダー（OTS）ショットに切り替わり、華妃に焦点を当てる。
華妃は大げさに目を丸める（古典的な「目玉を転がす」表情）。
きゅうりの漬物を持ったまま、長いネイルガードをはめた指で指差したりジェスチャーしたりしながら、傲慢な口調で話す（リップシンク）：
「今年も、私の KPI はまたしてもこの小悪魔たちを打ち負かすことよ。あの老いぼれ皇帝が美学について何を知っているっていうの？」

4～6秒：
素早く甄嬛のオーバー・ザ・ショルダー（OTS）ショットに切り替わる。
対照的なディテール：甄嬛は片耳にモダンな白い Bluetooth イヤホンを装着し（古代の装飾品との強い対比）、手には薄いタブレット端末を持ってスクロールしている。
彼女は冷静かつプロフェッショナルに答える（リップシンク）：
「お姉様、怒らないでください。これは職場の内巻（インボリューション）というものです。私は辞めて『舒痕膠』（傷跡除去バーム）を売ろうかと考えています。」

6～8秒：
クローズアップショットが二人の間のコーヒーテーブルに焦点を当てる。
伝統的な磁器の花瓶の隣に、「一丈紅」（一筋の赤）と書かれたモダンなプラスチック製のタピオカティーカップが置かれている。
カメラは素早く二人に戻る。

8～10秒：
ステージ全体像。
観客の笑い声の効果（照明の変化／拍手ライトで表現）。
華妃は最後のポーズを取る：足を組み、顎を上げ、再び目を丸める。
甄嬛はニュースキャスターのように、カメラに向かってプロフェッショナルな笑顔を見せる。
金色の紙吹雪が空から舞い落ちる。
祝祭的な赤い雰囲気が最高潮に達する。

スタイルと雰囲気：

**ビジュアル：** 高彩度の春晩らしい赤と金色のトーン
**衣装：** 博物館級の清朝宮廷衣装（シルク、精巧な刺繍、重厚な頭飾り）
**核心的な対比：** 清朝宮廷の厳粛な作法 × 現代の会社員／トークショーゲストのくつろいだ、不平を言う姿勢
**撮影：** シャープなリズム、明確なコメディポイント、シットコム風の編集
**アスペクト比：** 16:9
```

### Seedance 2.0 時代劇タイムトラベルドラマ予告編プロンプト

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> Seedance 2.0 用の、詳細かつ複数シーンからなるプロンプト。「Drunken Dream of Splendor」という歴史タイムトラベルドラマの 15 秒予告編を生成する。男性主人公の容姿には参考画像を使用。

#### 📝 プロンプト

```
参考写真のキャラクター画像を使用して、歴史タイムトラベルドラマの予告編を作成してください。

0～3秒のシーン：参考画像1を基にした男性主人公がバスケットボールを掲げ、カメラを見上げます。彼は「ただ飲み物が欲しかっただけなのに、タイムトラベルでもするのか…？」と言います。

4～8秒のシーン：カメラが突然激しく揺れ、遊び場のシーンが激しく振動し始め、すぐに雨の降る夜の古い邸宅に切り替わります。古代の衣装をまとった美しい女性主人公が、冷たい目で雨の中をカメラの方を見つめます。雷が鳴り響き、服が風になびいています。女性主人公は「誰が私の永寧侯爵邸に侵入する勇気があるというのだ？」と言います。

9～13秒のシーン：カメラは明朝の官服を着た男が衙門（裁判所）に座っている姿に切り替わります。彼の目はナイフのように鋭く、「衛兵！この『妖魔』を直ちに捕らえよ！」と怒鳴ります。フラッシュバック：男性主人公はサイズの合わない粗末な服を着ています。彼は捕吏に囲まれ必死に逃げます。雨の降る路地で女性主人公とすれ違います。男性主人公は官服を着て宮殿を歩いています。

14～15秒のシーン：画面が真っ暗になり、重いドラムの音とともに「酔夢絢爛」というタイトルが表示されます。
