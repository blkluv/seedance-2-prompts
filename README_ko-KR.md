### Horror Short Film Script: The Mirror Glitch

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, three-scene script prompt for a pseudo-documentary (Vlog style) short film with a suspenseful, slightly horrific tone. The plot centers on a young woman brushing her teeth, where the reflection in the mirror exhibits a delayed, independent consciousness before glitching and disappearing, leaving the protagonist confused and scared. Requires a reference image of the protagonist.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
[Style] Pseudo-documentary (Vlog Style), hyperrealism, fixed camera real-shot feel, natural light, with a touch of suspense and horror. 
[Duration] 15 seconds 
[Protagonist (Remember to upload reference image)] A sexy young woman preparing to wash up and go to bed in front of her bathroom sink. 
[00:00-00:06] Shot 1: Normalcy. Scene: In front of a regular large bathroom mirror. Action: The protagonist is brushing her teeth, mouth full of foam. She makes various funny faces at the mirror while brushing (winking and squinting). Key Detail: The reflection in the mirror is completely normal and synchronized with her actions. 
[00:06-00:11] Shot 2: The Glitch. Action: The protagonist finishes brushing, spits out the foam, and turns to leave the bathroom. High-Energy Moment (Core Plot Point): Just as the protagonist's real body turns and leaves the mirror frame, the “reflection” in the mirror **does not move**! The “reflection” remains in the brushing posture, even smirking and raising an eyebrow at the camera, staying for a full 2 seconds before suddenly “screen glitching” in panic to catch up with the body's action and disappear. Director's Note: Must create an extremely realistic sense of “network delay,” giving the reflection a feeling of independent consciousness. 
[00:11-00:15] Shot 3: The Punchline. Action: The protagonist, who has reached the door, seems to sense something is wrong and quickly turns back to look at the mirror. Result: The mirror has completely returned to normal, empty, only reflecting the opposite wall. The protagonist looks confused and scared, glances around the room, and shows a horrified expression. The frame freezes on the protagonist's bewildered face (horror movie effect).

### Absurd Comedy Video Prompt for Seedance 2.0: Nothing

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-scene video prompt for Seedance 2.0, creating an absurd, black comedy narrative. The story involves a confident rider on a horse expecting a crowd's adoration, only for the crowd to ignore him and rush towards a steamed bun shop instead, ending with the rider's self-mocking realization of 'Nothing.' The prompt includes specific scene descriptions, camera work, timing, and dialogue.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
Scene 1: Galloping Horse + Enthusiastic Crowd Approaching (0:00-0:08, 8 seconds)
• Location: Main winding road in a Vancouver luxury residential area (wide asphalt road, large detached mansions on both sides, evergreen pines covered with light snow)
• Subject: A rider in a dark suit galloping at full speed on a white horse, the horse's hooves airborne, mane flying
• Environment: Light snow falling, mansions flashing past, outline of the North Shore mountains and ocean in the distance
• Crowd: A large group of enthusiastic supporters suddenly appears ahead (diverse young people), waving yellow dragon flags + “Nothing” signs, shouting and cheering, surging towards the rider
• Camera: Medium-speed frontal follow shot → Switches to rider's perspective (POV), crowd getting closer
• Atmosphere: Climax continues, the rider smiles confidently, preparing to pull the reins (hand already raised towards the reins, relaxed posture, corner of the mouth upturned)
Scene 2: Reversal—Crowd Passes Straight Through, Ignoring the Rider (0:08-0:14, 6 seconds)
• Location: Same road, a Chinese steamed bun shop appears around the corner (sign “Qingfeng Baozi Shop,” warm lighting, simple plastic tables and chairs in the outdoor area, steam rising)
• Subject: The rider is about to wave in greeting, but the crowd ignores him, rushing past him on both sides/around him, heading to queue/surge into the bun shop entrance
• Action: The rider's smile freezes, his hand stops mid-air, his expression changes from anticipation to shock/confusion (wind messes up his hair, the hem of his suit flutters)
• Details: The crowd shouts “Baozi! Baozi!”, yellow dragon flags wave chaotically, the “Nothing” sign is pushed aside; the white horse is forced to halt in small steps or turn sideways to avoid them
• Camera: Quick pan/wide-angle shot, showing the crowd flowing like a tide around the rider (the horse is “passed through” in the center of the frame), the rider is left alone in the middle
• Atmosphere: Absurd reversal, awkward confusion, black humor climax
Scene 3: Eating Buns and Dialogue Outside the Bun Shop (0:14-0:20, 6 seconds)
• Location: Outdoor area of Qingfeng Baozi Shop (plastic tables and chairs, steaming baskets, luxury residential road in the background)
• Subject: Two ordinary young people (wearing down jackets) sitting in the queue seats, eating buns heartily
• Action: One person takes a bite of the bun, closes their eyes in satisfaction, “Ah, so fragrant.” (Close-up shot of the bun being bitten open, showing steam/juice)
• Dialogue:
First person (eating while looking towards the road): Who is that guy?
Second person (thoughtfully, chewing the bun, looking into the distance): Nothing.
• Camera: Medium shot of two people → Slight push-in on facial expressions (satisfied + calm), the rider's receding figure is vaguely visible in the background
• Atmosphere: Down-to-earth, contrasting cuteness, referencing the theme “nothing”
Scene 4: Rider Self-Mockingly Continues Galloping Away (0:20-0:30, 10 seconds)
• Location: Wide, extending road in the luxury residential area (straight ahead, mansions gradually receding)
• Subject: The rider on the horse, his expression changing from confusion to a confident smile
• Action: He reaches into his suit breast pocket, pulls out a packaged sandwich, takes a big bite (juice/crumbs splatter), then shakes his head dashingly, lightly taps the white horse with the reins, and continues galloping forward
• Environment: The mansion complex shrinks in the background, the evergreen trees on both sides of the road and the supporters (now stopped) can only be seen waving from afar, the Vancouver-style mountain and sea skyline in the distance (snowy and hazy)
• Details: The white horse's tail swings, hoof prints are left on the lightly snow-covered road, the bite mark on the sandwich is clear, the rider smiles confidently
• Camera: From close-up (sandwich bite detail) → Slowly pulls back to an extreme long shot, low-angle perspective, emphasizing the “don't care” sense of isolated heroism; finally fades out
• Atmosphere: Self-mocking yet dashing, heroic and unrestrained, symbolic ending (“Nothing” can still move forward)
```

### Surreal Battlefield Ronin Action Scene

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, multi-shot prompt for Seedance 2.0 describing a surreal, high-action battlefield scene in the sky, featuring a masked ronin pursued by a colossal winged beast whose chest is a vortex of storm clouds. The prompt includes specific camera movements, technical details (720p, 16:9, 15 seconds), and a dramatic finale.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
A surreal battlefield in the sky: floating rock islands drifting through a thunderstorm, clouds swirling below like an ocean. The masked ronin dashes across the drifting platforms, pursued by a colossal winged beast whose chest is a swirling vortex of storm clouds and lightning. The camera hurtles from island to island, struggling to keep up as rocks tilt, spin, and crumble away beneath them. Every wingbeat sends shockwaves through the air, shaking the frame and blowing debris and rain straight into the viewer’s face. Rapid handheld cuts capture the ronin leaping impossible gaps, sword carving arcs of light that briefly cut through the darkness. The finale shows the camera diving behind him as he jumps off the last crumbling rock, riding a bolt of lightning directly into the monster’s chest vortex with a final, all-or-nothing slash that explodes the storm from within and clears the sky in a blinding flash.

### The Flash Director's Prompt

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, multi-part 'Director’s Prompt' used with Seedance 2.0 via ChatCut, describing a complex, dynamic, and cinematic sequence featuring The Flash accelerating and creating a time portal.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
Opening Shot:
Extreme close-up on The Flash’s boots touching wet asphalt at night. Raindrops freeze midair as time slows. Golden lightning begins to crawl over his suit, crackling softly.
Camera: Low-angle, slow push-in.
As he leans forward, the world stretches and distorts. On the beat, he launches. The camera snaps into pursuit as he explodes forward in a blinding burst of red and gold lightning, tearing through the city streets. Buildings smear into light trails, traffic lights become streaks of color, thunder rolling underneath the sound design.

DIRECTOR’S PROMPT — PART 2

The Flash accelerates beyond the city, racing across highways, deserts, and oceans in seconds. The curvature of the Earth becomes visible as clouds rip apart beneath him.
Camera: Dynamic tracking shot with heavy motion blur, lightning arcing outward like veins of energy.
Time fractures — day and night collapse into one continuous run. As he reaches maximum velocity, the lightning intensifies into near-white brilliance. He vanishes in a final thunderous flash, leaving only scorched air, fading electricity, and silence.

DIRECTOR’S PROMPT — PART 3

A low, resonant hum builds. The air ahead fractures like glass. A circular portal forms — ancient, unstable — glowing with swirling light and dust, as if time itself is being torn open.
```

### One Piece Inspired Text-to-Video Prompt

> A detailed, narrative prompt for Seedance 2.0, inspired by a chapter of One Piece, describing a dramatic rescue scene involving hostages, a villain, and the appearance of Loki in dragon form, alongside Gear 5 Luffy and Ragnir the squirrel.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
The hostage children cannot stop walking and steadily approach the edge of the harbor and the hole opened in the sea clouds by the destruction of the ship.
Sommers says, "I don't care if they die; I can just kidnap other Giant children later." Ripley and the children's families desperately try to stop them, but realizing they can't, they embrace the children—and everyone falls. But...!!!
Loki appears and saves them.
He transforms into a giant black dragon and grabs everyone from the sky (Loki's Devil Fruit name is not revealed in this chapter). The chapter concludes with Loki in dragon form, Gear 5 Luffy, and Ragnir in squirrel form riding on Loki's head, ready to launch an attack on the MMA monsters.

### Demon Slayer Live-Action Battle Prompt for Seedance 2.0

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, high-energy video prompt for Seedance 2.0 generating a 15-second live-action adaptation of a Demon Slayer-style battle (Water Breathing vs. Thunder Breathing). The prompt specifies the style (Hollywood live-action manga adaptation, dark samurai, 4K, extreme quick cuts, particle light effects), the setting (misty forest at night), and three distinct shots detailing the characters' actions, power-up sequences, and the final clash.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
Live-Action Manga Adaptation · Breathing Style Decisive Battle (15 seconds · Ultra-Burning Special Effects Version)
【Core Focus】: Water Breathing (Blue Water Dragon) VS Thunder Breathing (Golden Lightning), live-action extreme speed duel.
【Style】: Hollywood live-action manga adaptation film quality, dark samurai style, 4K ultra-clear, extreme quick cuts, particle light effects explosion, no gore.
【Duration】: 15 seconds
【Scene】: Misty forest under the moonlight, muddy ground, falling leaves.
[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Water Melody Prelude · Starting Form (Sense of Charging)
Visuals: A young samurai wearing a green and black checkered haori (jacket), lowers his center of gravity under the moonlight, holding his sword with both hands.
Action: He takes a deep breath, and the surrounding air instantly solidifies. As he draws his sword, a giant blue water dragon, condensed from high-pressure water flow, appears out of thin air, rotating rapidly around his body and blade, emitting the roar of flowing water.
Special Effects Details: The water flow has a realistic sense of splashing, illuminating the dark forest.
[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Thunder Flash · Advance (Sense of Extreme Speed)
Visuals: The opponent across from him, a blonde swordsman wearing a yellow triangular patterned haori, lowers his body extremely low, taking the stance of an Iaijutsu (sword drawing technique).
Action: The ground suddenly explodes. His entire body instantly transforms into a dazzling golden lightning afterimage, rapidly refracting and advancing in a 'Z' shape through the trees at a speed invisible to the naked eye.
Special Effects Details: Golden electric arcs and scorched fallen leaves remain in the places he passes.
[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Water-Thunder Collision · Final Sound (Clash of Ultimate Moves)
Visuals: Extreme speed head-on collision. The young samurai swings the giant blue water dragon down to meet the attack, and the blonde swordsman, transformed into lightning, crashes into it.
Action: The two swords violently collide in the center of the frame.
Special Effects Spectacle: The blue water dragon and the golden lightning instantly explode, forming a massive water-thunder energy storm that spreads outward. The surrounding large trees are snapped in half by the energy wave, and mud, water, and light obscure the camera. The scene ends in an extremely dazzling blue, yellow, and white light.

### Xianxia Animated Film Battle Script: Han Li vs. Wang Lin

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, four-scene script prompt for a 15-second, high-energy duel in the style of a Chinese Xianxia (immortal hero) animated film. The prompt features a battle between the characters Han Li (with golden flying swords) and Wang Lin (with a massive cyan phantom hand and a black sphere of destruction), emphasizing ultra-fine 3D CG rendering and a strong gold/cyan color contrast.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
Chinese Xianxia animated film style, ultra-fine 3D CG rendering, 15-second high-energy duel sequence, strong contrast between gold and cyan dual tones. 0-3 seconds: Extreme long shot, two streams of light rapidly clash from both sides of the frame in chaotic void—on the left, faintly visible in the golden light is a middle-aged cultivator in a cyan-gray Daoist robe, his face calm as water, holding a small green sword, who is Han Li; on the right, in the cyan-black malevolent aura, a thin man in white hair and black robes stands with his hands behind his back, his eyes deep as an ancient well, surrounded by world-destroying energy, who is Wang Lin. The two face each other from afar, the void cracking due to the collision of their auras, accompanied by a low thunderous roar. 4-8 seconds: Han Li forms a hand seal to activate the Azure Bamboo Cloud-Swarm Swords, seventy-two flying swords transform into a golden storm of sword rain sweeping away; Wang Lin points with his right hand, and a giant cyan phantom hand that covers the sky condenses behind him. The giant hand slaps down against the sword rain, and the moment the sword energy and palm force collide, a golden and cyan energy torrent erupts, the shockwave spreading in all directions and tearing the void, accompanied by the sound of metal collision and space shattering. 9-12 seconds: Freeze frame slow motion, a golden phantom of ten thousand Buddhas appears behind Han Li, his eyes shining with golden light, and the Ten Thousand Swords Return to the Origin condense into a hundred-zhang golden sword light slashing down; a hint of madness flashes in Wang Lin's eyes, and he growls, "If heaven does not tolerate me, I shall defy it!" He raises his right hand high, and a rotating black sphere condenses in his palm, emitting destructive energy that twists space. The two ultimate forces collide head-on, and time seems to stand still. 13-15 seconds: Massive energy explosion, the screen is swallowed by white light and slowly dissipates. In the smoke and dust, two figures stand back-to-back in the shattered void, their robes tattered, both panting. Han Li speaks faintly, "I admire your heaven-defying technique," and a slight smile appears on Wang Lin's lips. The sound effects converge into the crisp sound of void fragments falling and a fading wind sound.

### Sci-Fi Transformation Short Film Script: Awakening Future

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, six-scene script prompt for a high-impact, cinematic short film titled 'Awakening Future.' The video features a dramatic transformation from an ancient, pure salt lake goddess into a neon-lit cyberpunk warrior, emphasizing IMAX quality, high contrast, and ARRI Alexa 65mm aesthetics.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
[Film Setting] Cinematic quality, IMAX aspect ratio, ARRI Alexa 65mm, high contrast, cyberpunk aesthetic, 8K resolution.

[Core Concept] Space-time folding. Instantaneous awakening from an ancient, pure Salt Lake Goddess to a neon warrior in a future city.

Shot 1: Wide shot, slow push-in. The scene is extremely still. A girl in red and white ethnic attire, wearing silver ornaments, stands on the mirror-like white salt lake. The sunlight is sacred, the background is continuous snow-capped mountains, the wind blows her clothes, full of divinity.

Shot 2: Extreme Close-up (ECU), match cut. The camera rapidly pushes into the girl's eyes. Her pupils instantly dilate, reflecting backward digital streams and blue data light effects.

Shot 3: Jump cut, glitch art interference. The screen is instantly torn by intense neon light. The white salt lake background instantly transforms into a flickering holographic billboard of a cyber city on a rainy night.

Shot 4: Medium shot, low-angle upward view. Visual impact. She still stands in the center of the frame, but her ethnic robe has changed into high-tech reflective functional clothing. The original silver headpiece has become metallic flowing light headphones.

Shot 5: Close-up, light and shadow flow. Rain falls on her face, reflecting pink and purple neon lights. She gives a cold smile to the camera, reaches out to put on goggles, and her aura is fully unleashed.

Shot 6: Extreme long shot, freeze frame. She stands on top of a skyscraper overlooking the entire steel jungle, with a giant holographic projection of a whale swimming behind her. Subtitle: “Awakening Future.”

Duration: 10 seconds | Style: Top Hollywood commercial film | Visual Impact: Extremely strong

### Cinematic Wingsuit Flight Sequence

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, multi-shot prompt for Seedance Pro 2.0 describing a cinematic aerial sequence of a wingsuit pilot diving from a snow-covered mountain peak, performing proximity flight through ice formations, and deploying a parachute over an alpine lake.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
A cinematic video sequence opening with a serene wide aerial shot of a pristine snow-covered mountain peak at dawn, the summit piercing through a sea of clouds with alpenglow painting the ice formations pink and gold. The camera transitions to follow a wingsuit pilot who leaps from the peak, immediately entering a steep vertical dive through wispy clouds. The tracking shot positions just behind and above the pilot as they accelerate downward, the camera shaking subtly from air turbulence, frost particles streaming past. The pilot pulls into a proximity flight, skimming within meters of sheer cliff faces and jagged ice formations, the camera banking and rolling to match every precise movement. Shadows and light play across the wingsuit's surface as the pilot threads through a narrow ice chimney, walls rushing past in a blur of blue and white. Speed intensifies as they enter a massive glacial valley, weaving between enormous ice pillars and frozen waterfalls, mist and powder snow kicked up in spiraling trails. The pilot executes a dramatic barrel roll around a freestanding ice spire before pulling the parachute at the last possible moment. The camera follows upward through the deceleration, then pulls wide to reveal a breathtaking hidden alpine lake surrounded by untouched snow fields, perfectly still and mirror-like, reflecting the morning sky.
```

### Seedance 2.0 Prompting Techniques and Templates

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A comprehensive guide to writing effective Seedance 2.0 prompts, including a universal formula (Subject + Action + Scene + Lighting + Camera Language + Style + Quality + Constraints), tips for describing actions and camera movements, stabilization techniques, and two ready-to-use templates for portrait and landscape videos.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
① Universal Formula

Subject + Action + Scene + Lighting + Camera Language + Style + Quality + Constraints

Example:
A young girl walking slowly by the sea, hair gently moved by the breeze, natural smile, warm light at sunset, medium shot, slow push-in, stable and smooth footage, 4K high definition, cinematic feel, clear face without deformation.

② Action Description

Don't just write: walking / dancing
Write: slow + continuous + natural

Priority words:
slow, gentle, natural, continuous, smooth, not stiff

Useful combinations:
slow turn / gently raise hand / slightly lower head / sway with the wind

③ Camera Language

Seedance is very strong at recognizing camera movements, remember to write:

Close-up / Medium Shot / Special Shot
Slow push-in / slight pull-out / smooth horizontal pan / stable follow-shot

Example:
Medium shot, slow push-in, stable follow-shot, smooth footage without stuttering

④ Anti-face change / Anti-deformation

Very important:

Clear face, stable features, no deformation
Normal human structure, natural proportions
Same character, consistent clothing, unchanged hairstyle

⑤ General words for quality enhancement

4K, ultra-high definition, rich details, sharp clarity
Cinematic feel, soft light and shadow, natural colors
No blur, no flicker, stable footage

⑥ Style / Atmosphere words

Healing and fresh / Japanese style / Korean atmosphere
Retro film grain / dreamy soft light / cyberpunk
Minimalist clean / high-end texture

⑦ Multi-shot writing (Advanced usage)

Describe in sequence, do not break up randomly:

Start with close-up of face → slow pull-out → character walks slowly → camera follows smoothly → end with a freeze-frame smile

⑧ Avoidance Guide

❌ Intense running/jumping / complex multi-person interaction
❌ Vague words: good-looking / very beautiful / very cool
❌ Contradictory requirements: ultra-high speed + extreme stability

⑨ Templates that can be copied directly

Portrait atmosphere short video
A young girl walking slowly in the forest, hair gently moved by the breeze, natural smile, medium shot, slow push-in, stable and smooth footage, 4K high definition, cinematic feel, clear face without deformation.

Landscape atmosphere
Sunset by the sea, waves gently lapping the beach, camera slowly panning horizontally, warm orange tones, smooth footage, 4K ultra-high definition, no flicker or ghosting.

⑩ Summary of Tips

1️⃣ Write actions slowly and continuously
2️⃣ Write camera movements stably and simply
3️⃣ Must add stable / no deformation / not stiff
4️⃣ Quality & style are added last
5️⃣ Less complexity, more precision
```

### Cross-Style Battle Prompt for Seedance 2.0: Goku vs. Monkey King

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-scene video prompt for Seedance 2.0 depicting a 15-second cross-style battle between two versions of Sun Wukong (Monkey King): the Japanese anime style (Dragon Ball's Goku) and the classic Chinese mythology style. The prompt specifies the visual contrast, timing, dialogue, special effects (Kamehameha, Jingu Bang), and the final scene where the two worlds merge.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
15-second cross-style duel shot, with a sharp contrast between the Japanese anime cel-style on the left and the Chinese mythology realistic style on the right. 0-3 seconds: Extreme long shot, a dimensional rift descends in the center of the frame, splitting the screen in two—the left side is a Dragon Ball-style desolate landscape of red rock and soil, with Son Goku in Super Saiyan state standing hands on hips, his orange battle suit tightly defining his muscles, surrounded by the golden electric aura of a Super Saiyan; the right side is the cloud-shrouded Flower and Fruit Mountain, with the classic Monkey King wearing chain-mail golden armor, a phoenix-winged purple-gold crown, and holding the Ruyi Jingu Bang, standing on the mountain peak, auspicious clouds swirling behind him. The two stare at each other across the rift, the edges of the rift unstable and flashing due to the style conflict, accompanied by a low sound of spacetime distortion. 4-8 seconds: Both shout simultaneously—Anime Goku: "You look a lot like me, you guy!" with a youthful, passionate anime voice; Classic Monkey King: "Bold demon monkey, how dare you steal my name!" with a deep, operatic voice. Both rush out of the rift and cross paths. Anime Goku unleashes a Kamehameha wave of pink-blue energy, and Classic Monkey King swings the Jingu Bang in a sweeping strike. The moment the energy wave and the Jingu Bang collide, a style-tearing effect occurs—the intersection of the two forces pixelates, flashes, and color blocks collapse and reorganize, accompanied by the angry roar of the Kamehameha "Ka-me-ha-me-HA" and the whistling sound of the Jingu Bang cutting through the air. 9-12 seconds: Freeze frame slow motion, Anime Goku activates Ultra Instinct, his body shrouded in silver-gray aura, his eyes turning calm silver-gray, moving like lightning to flash behind Classic Monkey King; Classic Monkey King's Fiery Eyes and Golden Gaze suddenly light up with golden-red light, his body transforms into a shadow clone using the Heaven and Earth Law—his body swells to a hundred zhang (hundreds of feet) in size, and the Jingu Bang in his hand simultaneously enlarges like a pillar supporting the sky, smashing down directly. 13-15 seconds: The silver-gray aura's rapid punches and the sky-supporting Jingu Bang collide head-on in the center of the frame. The shockwave tears the dimensional rift, and both the Dragon Ball wasteland and Flower and Fruit Mountain are swallowed by the energy torrent. After a flash of white light, the smoke and dust clear, and two figures stand back-to-back in the merged new world—a strange terrain blending mountains and wasteland. Anime Goku scratches his head and laughs, saying, "What powerful strength, let's fight again next time," and Classic Monkey King lightly strokes his monkey whiskers and nods, "I'll find another place to play next time." The sound effects conclude with the hearty laughter of both and a fading wind sound.

### Northeast China Sweet Girl Livestream MC Short Film Script

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, three-scene script prompt for a vertical (9:16) short film featuring a 'Northeast Sweet Girl' streamer doing a high-energy MC (Master of Ceremonies) slow roll performance in a high-end, cyberpunk-neon livestream studio, set to the DJ version of 'Night Paris.' The prompt includes character descriptions, synchronized backup dancers, and virtual gift effects.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
[Style] Douyin/Kuaishou vertical screen (TikTok Portrait 9:16), high-end influencer livestream studio (High-end Livestream Studio), cyberpunk neon light, 4K quality, Northeast MC Slow Roll style (Dongbei MC Slow Roll), extremely rhythmic.
[Duration] 15 seconds
[BGM Setting] “Night Paris” DJ Slow Roll version.
[Characters]
1. Protagonist: Northeast Sweet Girl, extremely sweet and cute appearance (twin pigtails/big eyes), but dressed in a “sweet and cool” style (pink furry jacket + tight camisole), wearing huge rhinestone headphones, holding a professional condenser microphone.
2. Supporting Characters: Two black-clad assistants (Backups), wearing sunglasses, expressionless, standing behind the sweet girl on the left and right, cool like bodyguards.

[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Sweet Girl Starts the Show (The Intro).
Visuals: Lights focus on the sweet girl's face. She smiles sweetly at the camera, then her eyes instantly become sharp (entering MC state).
Action: Following the heavy bass rhythm, she presses one hand on her headphones, and her body begins to sway rhythmically left and right (Swaying).
Background: The two black-clad assistants behind her synchronously start nodding and shaking their shoulders, movements uniform, creating a strong sense of pressure.
[Atmosphere] High-end, mesmerizing, decadent.

[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Night Paris Climax (The Climax).
Visuals: The large screen in the background of the livestream studio displays dazzling neon words “Night Paris” and a laser projection of the Eiffel Tower.
Action: The sweet girl holds the microphone with both hands, her expression intoxicated and confident, her body swaying dramatically with the rhythm. The two assistants behind her cooperate by performing “hand flower” movements, maximizing the atmosphere.
[Visual Details] Golden streamers and champagne-colored light spots float in the air, and the lights flash wildly with the rhythm.

[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Full Display of Status (The Finale).
Visuals: The camera pulls back slightly to show the entire luxurious livestream studio.
Action: The sweet girl gives an extremely cool “gun” gesture (Wink) to the camera. The two assistants behind her simultaneously take out their sunglasses, put them on straight, and then cross their arms, looking incredibly cool.
[Effects] Virtual gift effects (sports cars, yachts) explode across the screen around the sweet girl, and the frame freezes on the trio's coolest pose.

### Tollywood Action Blockbuster Scene Script

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, three-scene script prompt for generating a high-octane, exaggerated Indian Tollywood action film sequence. The style emphasizes extreme slow-motion, anti-gravity physics, dust, and massive impact forces, featuring a confident hero fighting dozens of goons in a quarry.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
[Style]
Indian Telugu action blockbuster (Tollywood Action Blockbuster), extremely exaggerated physics effects (Anti-gravity Physics), slow-motion ramping (Ramp-mo), dusty, epic BGM atmosphere, no gore, focus on impact force.

[Duration] 15 seconds

[Scene]
A dusty abandoned quarry or construction site, strong sunlight, very windy.

[Characters]
Protagonist (Hero): With a signature mustache, wearing sunglasses and a denim jacket, walking with a swagger, extremely confident and dominant expression.
Opponents (Goons): Dozens of thugs in messy clothes, whose main purpose is to be sent flying.

[Scene Breakdown]
[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Divine Entrance and Minions Taking Flight (The Hero Entry)
Visuals: Extreme slow-motion (Super Slow-mo). The protagonist walks slowly, with a sky full of yellow sand stirred up by the strong wind behind him.
Action: He casually waves his hand (looks effortless).
Spectacular Effect: Just the force of his palm sends the five thugs rushing at the front flying high backward like broken kites, defying the laws of physics (at least 15 meters high), spinning in slow motion in the air.

[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Physics Defied
Visuals: Quick slow-motion switching. The protagonist instantly accelerates and rushes into the crowd.
Action: The protagonist delivers a spinning kick. The target hit instantly knocks down ten people behind him, creating a domino effect.
Spectacular Effect: A huge shockwave cracks the ground, kicking up a circle of dust. All thugs, upon contact with the protagonist's fists and feet, are dramatically launched outwards with a large amount of white powder (substituting blood), crashing into surrounding wooden boxes and props.

[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: The Ultimate Power Move
Visuals: The protagonist takes off his sunglasses and gives a charming, evil smile to the camera (Blinking Moment).
Action: A jeep rushes towards him. He does not dodge, but kicks it head-on.
Spectacular Effect: The moment his toe touches the jeep, it is kicked vertically into the air like a toy car, tumbling with parts scattering. The protagonist calmly puts his sunglasses back on and adjusts his hair against the background of falling car parts and flying thugs.

### Cinematic Cyberpunk Night Chase and Katana Fight

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> An extremely detailed, cinematic prompt for an image-to-video test in Seedance 2.0, describing a high-speed night chase in cyberpunk Tokyo featuring the character Cherry Blackcloud, who performs a complex drift maneuver to slice a drone with a katana.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
She does the most amazing kung fu. She yells with a Macedonian accent: "This is See dance 2.0, using only a first frame." Cinematic night chase in cyberpunk Tokyo rain: matte-black Nissan GT-R Nismo screams down wet neon street at 200 km/h, tires spraying water, headlights cutting through heavy rain. Cherry Blackcloud (20, Macedonian features, jet-black high ponytail whipping, sharp fringe, cybernetic ice-cyan right eye glowing) drives aggressively—fully zipped black McQueen leather jacket on bare skin, short black leather skirt with silver zipper visible, bare legs, chunky black platform boots on pedals, katana strapped to passenger seat. Camera starts wide tracking shot beside the GT-R, then quick push-in through rain-streaked windshield to tight close-up on Cherry’s intense face (left eye dark brown burning, right eye glowing cyan). She glances at rear-view mirror—pursuing drones closing in with red lasers.Cherry (thick Macedonian accent, low & commanding, over engine roar): “They think they can box me in.”She downshifts hard, GT-R fishtails, then launches into a perfect 180° drift—tires screeching, water exploding in arcs. Katana handle glints in cyan dashboard glow. She reaches over, grabs katana mid-drift, opens driver door while sliding sideways, leans out into rain, and slashes a precise arc—katana blade glowing cyan, slicing the lead drone in half in a shower of sparks and molten metal.Cherry (smirking, voice cutting through wind & rain): “Not today.”She snaps the door shut, floors the accelerator—GT-R rockets forward, neon reflections streaking across wet black paint. Camera pulls back fast to wide shot: car vanishing into rainy night, drones exploding behind in orange fireballs. Final frame: Cherry’s cyber-eye flares once as she disappears around a corner. Fade to black. Style & Technical Notes for Seedance 2.0 Photorealistic Hollywood action blockbuster style, ARRI Alexa cinematic look, teal-orange color grade, realistic heavy rain with water droplets and wet reflections on black car and leather, high dynamic range, 60fps, dramatic anamorphic lens flares from neon and explosions, subtle film grain, no artifacts, intense practical stunt choreography, dynamic camera work (tracking, push-in, 180° drift reveal, fast pull-back).

### Ronin vs. Colossal Mechanical Beast

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> A highly detailed, cinematic prompt for Seedance Pro 2.0 describing an action sequence where a masked ronin fights a colossal mechanical beast in a dense industrial refinery during a thunderstorm, focusing on camera movement, environment, and explosive action.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
A dense industrial refinery during a thunderstorm, metal catwalks and pipes forming a maze above a sea of fire and steam. The masked ronin, lit by flashing warning lights, confronts a colossal mechanical beast with hydraulic limbs and a furnace burning in its chest. The camera barrels after the ronin as he sprints along swaying catwalks, the structure groaning and buckling under the monster’s weight. Sparks and steam constantly obscure the frame as the beast’s limbs smash through railings and tanks, causing explosions that hurl the camera off-axis. Quick, shaky close-ups capture the ronin sliding under swinging metal arms and using chains and cables to slingshot himself upward. In the final movement, the camera chases him in a dizzying upward spiral as he climbs the creature’s back, then cuts to a wide but still trembling shot as he plunges his sword into the furnace chest, sending a pillar of flame skyward that silhouettes his figure against the stormy sky.

### Gothic Dragon Battle Video Prompt for Seedance 2.0 vs. Kling 3.0

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> A detailed, multi-scene video prompt for Seedance 2.0 (and Kling 3.0 comparison) depicting a high-intensity battle against a black dragon in the ruins of a Gothic cathedral. The prompt specifies the setting, the actions of two characters (a female warrior and a warrior in black armor), the timing for each of the five shots, the fast-paced editing style, camera movements (shaking, tracking), and the final explosive conclusion.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
Use the three characters and scene in the image to create a battle. 【Scene Setting】 Ruins of a Gothic cathedral, leaning stone pillars, twilight filtering through broken stained glass, dust floating. 0-3 seconds: The female warrior advances cautiously with a spear, the camera follows her back. Suddenly, a black dragon pounces from the shadows, its claws tearing the ground slabs, debris splashing. The female warrior rolls to dodge, the spear drawing an arc of light. The camera shakes violently, the dragon's roar reverberates through the cathedral. 4-6 seconds: The black armored warrior rushes in, slamming his shield into the side of the dragon's head, a dull roar of metal hitting bone. The dragon's head is knocked to one side, saliva spraying from its fangs. Quick cut to the female warrior, who leaps up, thrusting the spear tip directly into the gap between the scales on the dragon's neck, sparks flying. The camera follows the instant of the spear tip's impact. 7-9 seconds: The black dragon angrily sweeps its tail, the tail blade severing a stone pillar. The pillar collapses with a crash, falling towards the two warriors. The black armored warrior raises his shield to brace the impact, the shield surface dented, his feet plowing deep marks in the ground. The female warrior slides low, passing through the rain of debris, her spear scraping sparks on the ground. The dragon's wings spread, obscuring the light, plunging the cathedral into shadow. 10-12 seconds: The female warrior fiercely stabs the dragon's abdomen, the spear deeply embedded. The black dragon painfully raises its head and roars, its neck swelling, a red light surging in its throat. The black armored warrior senses danger, sprints and tackles the female warrior, rolling backward. The next instant, dragon fire erupts, a column of flame engulfing the spot where they just were, the stone slabs melting into magma. The camera distorts and warps in the heatwave. 13-15 seconds: Both warriors launch their finishing moves simultaneously. The black armored warrior shield-smashes the dragon's neck joint from the flank, and the female warrior throws her spear with full force from the front, the spear spinning as it pierces the dragon's throat. The black dragon's body stiffens, crashing heavily onto the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust. The camera pulls back and freezes: the two warriors stand panting, the giant dragon lying dead in the center of the cathedral, the twilight filtering through the broken stained glass illuminating the battlefield ruins. Quickly fades to black.

### 웅장한 고딕 전투 장면 비디오 프롬프트

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> Seedance 2.0을 위한 매우 상세하고 다중 장면으로 구성된 프롬프트로, 고딕 성당 폐허에서 여성 전사와 검은 갑옷을 입은 전사가 검은 용과 싸우는 장대한 전투 비디오를 생성합니다. 이 프롬프트에는 특정 장면 설정, 액션, 카메라 움직임 및 스타일 지침이 포함되어 있습니다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
이미지에 있는 세 명의 캐릭터와 장면을 사용하여 전투를 만들어 보세요. [장면 설정] 고딕 양식 대성당의 폐허, 부서진 돌기둥, 깨진 스테인드글라스를 통해 스며드는 황혼, 떠다니는 먼지. 0-3초: 여전사가 창을 들고 조심스럽게 전진하고, 카메라는 그녀의 뒤를 따라갑니다. 갑자기 검은 용이 그림자 속에서 튀어나와 발톱으로 돌바닥을 찢고 파편이 튀어 오릅니다. 여전사는 굴러서 피하고, 창은 빛의 궤적을 그립니다. 카메라가 격렬하게 흔들리고, 용의 포효가 대성당에 울려 퍼집니다. 4-6초: 검은 갑옷을 입은 전사가 달려들어 방패로 용의 머리 옆구리를 강타하고, 금속이 뼈에 부딪히는 둔탁한 소리가 납니다. 용의 머리가 옆으로 젖혀지고, 이빨에서 침이 튀어 나옵니다. 여전사에게 빠르게 전환되고, 그녀는 그 추진력을 이용해 뛰어올라 창끝을 용의 목에 있는 비늘 틈새에 정확히 겨냥하고 불꽃이 튀어 오릅니다. 카메라는 충돌의 순간을 따라갑니다. 7-9초: 검은 용이 맹렬하게 꼬리를 휘두르고, 꼬리 칼날이 돌기둥을 자릅니다. 기둥이 굉음과 함께 무너져 두 전사에게로 쓰러집니다. 검은 갑옷을 입은 전사는 방패를 들어 막고, 방패 표면은 움푹 들어가고, 그의 발은 땅에 깊은 자국을 남깁니다. 여전사는 파편의 비를 뚫고 낮게 미끄러지며, 그녀의 창은 땅에 불꽃을 일으킵니다. 용의 날개가 펼쳐져 빛을 가리고, 대성당은 그림자 속으로 잠깁니다. 10-12초: 여전사가 용의 복부를 찌르고, 창이 깊숙이 박힙니다. 검은 용은 고통스럽게 머리를 뒤로 젖히고 포효하며, 목이 부풀어 오르고, 목구멍에서 붉은 빛이 솟아오릅니다. 검은 갑옷을 입은 전사는 위험을 감지하고, 여전사를 향해 전력 질주하여 그녀를 태클하고 뒤로 구릅니다. 다음 순간, 용의 불이 터져 나와 불기둥이 그들이 방금 있던 곳을 삼키고, 돌은 녹아내려 용암이 됩니다. 카메라는 열기로 인해 왜곡됩니다. 13-15초: 두 전사가 동시에 마무리 공격을 시작합니다. 검은 갑옷을 입은 전사는 측면에서 용의 목 관절을 방패로 강타하고, 여전사는 정면에서 창을 전력으로 던져 창이 회전하며 용의 목을 꿰뚫습니다. 검은 용의 몸이 굳어지고, 땅에 무겁게 쓰러져 먼지 구름을 일으킵니다. 카메라는 고정된 샷으로 뒤로 물러납니다: 두 전사는 헐떡이며 서 있고, 거대한 용은 대성당 중앙에 죽어 누워 있으며, 깨진 스테인드글라스를 통해 스며드는 황혼이 전장 폐허를 비춥니다. 빠르게 암전됩니다. [스타일 설명] • 빠른 편집, 슬로우 모션 없음 • 충격 시 카메라 격렬하게 흔들림, 먼지 폭발 • 무기와 비늘 충돌 순간을 포착하는 클로즈업 샷 • 불빛과 황혼이 얽힌 어두운 고딕 분위기 유지 • 음향 효과: 금속 충돌, 용의 포효, 기둥 붕괴, 불의 울부짖음 [카메라 움직임] 팔로우 스루 → 흔들리는 클로즈업 → 수평 팬/스윕 → 열기 왜곡 → 고정 샷으로 뒤로 물러남
```

### 여자친구 시점 브이로그: 타이베이 선셋 데이트

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 대만인 여자친구가 남자친구를 촬영하는 시점의 15초 세로 POV 브이로그 영상 제작 프롬프트. 타이베이 단수이 강변의 골든 아워 일몰을 배경으로, 핸드헬드 촬영과 필름 그레인 필터를 사용하며, 귀엽고 살짝 투덜거리는 대만식 억양이 특징인 대화와 행동을 담고 있습니다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
【스타일】 여자친구 시점 (POV), 손으로 들고 찍는 셀카 VLOG, 세로 화면 (9:16), 필름 그레인 필터, 자연광 (골든 아워 일몰), 자연스러운 카메라 흔들림 및 조정.
【길이】 15초
【주인공】 대만 소녀, 살짝 곱슬거리는 긴 머리, 부드러운 니트 가디건 착용, 깨끗한 메이크업, 부드럽고 달콤하며 살짝 응석 부리는 듯한 불평하는 어조 (대만 억양).
【장면】 타이베이 단수이 강변, 배경은 황금빛 일몰, 반짝이는 강물, 멀리 보이는 연인의 다리.

[00:00-00:05] 샷 1: 서두르며 불평하기 (급한 도입).
영상: 그녀가 빠르게 걷고 있어서 카메라가 꽤 많이 흔들린다. 그녀는 걸으면서 카메라 (당신)를 뒤돌아보며 살짝 찡그린 얼굴로 화난 척한다.
액션: 한 손으로는 휴대폰을 들고, 다른 손으로는 바람에 날리는 머리카락을 누른다.
【대화/립싱크】 (부드럽게 불평하는 어조): "야, 빨리 걸어! 해 다 지겠어! 다 너 때문에 꾸물거린 거잖아. 예쁜 사진 못 찍으면 나 화낼 거야!"

[00:00-00:10] 샷 2: 풍경 공유하기 (풍경 공유).
영상: 그녀가 멈춰 서서 카메라를 얼굴에서 멀리 옮겨 강 건너편의 멋진 황금빛 일몰 (골든 아워)을 향하게 한다.
액션: 카메라가 2초 동안 풍경을 보여준 다음, 즉시 그녀의 얼굴로 돌아온다. 그녀의 얼굴은 일몰의 황금빛으로 물들어 있고, 눈을 가늘게 뜨며 매우 행복한 미소를 짓고 있다.
【대화/립싱크】 (감탄하는 어조): "와~ 봐봐! 진짜 예쁘지 않아! 이 조명은 정말 최고야, 뭘 찍어도 다 잘 나와!"

[00:10-00:15] 샷 3: 상호작용 및 마무리 (상호작용).
영상: 그녀의 손에 단수이 특유의 아주 높은 소프트 아이스크림이 갑자기 들려 있다.
액션: 그녀는 먼저 아이스크림을 카메라에 대고 (당신에게 먹여주는 척), 그러다 재빨리 자신이 핥아 먹다가 실수로 코에 아이스크림을 살짝 묻힌다. 그녀는 카메라를 보며 낄낄거린다.
【대화/립싱크】 (장난스러운 어조): "자, 너 먼저 한 입 먹어. 빨리, 녹고 있잖아! 헤헤, 오늘 데이트 합격!"

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
**성인 및 어린이 각 사진:** 밤에 회전하는 놀이터 바퀴에 앉아 있는 얼굴과 상반신 클로즈업을 원합니다. 의상은 변경하지 마세요. 프레임에는 얼굴과 어깨만 보이도록 합니다. 전체 배경은 빠르게 원형으로 회전하여 현기증 나는 회전 환상을 만듭니다. 어두운 하늘 아래 빛줄기, 나무, 구조물이 있는 흐릿한 밤 놀이터입니다. 고속을 강조하기 위해 배경에 약간의 모션 블러를 적용합니다. 피사체는 심각하고 우울한 표정을 유지하며 움직이지 않고 카메라를 똑바로 응시합니다. 시네마틱하고 분위기 있는 조명, 사실적인 스타일입니다. 수평으로 회전하는 배경 전체에 큰 강조를 둡니다.

### 무협 판타지 서사시: 검성 vs. 도마

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 구름 위 산산조각 난 고대 검 플랫폼에서 흰색 도포를 입은 검선(劍仙)과 검은 갑옷을 입은 도마(刀魔)의 장대한 전투를 묘사하는 15초 분량의 중국 무협 판타지 영화 제작을 위한 프롬프트로, 만 개의 검이 하나의 파괴적인 참격과 맞서는 궁극적인 충돌을 시네마틱 특수 효과로 담아냅니다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
【스타일】 동양 판타지 무협, 시네마틱 특수 효과 블록버스터, 웅장한 느낌, 슬로우 모션과 빠른 컷의 조합, 폭발적인 입자 빛 효과, 4K 초고화질.
【길이】 15초
【등장인물】 검성 (하얀 도포, 신선 같은 풍모) VS 도마 (검은 중갑옷, 압도적인 존재감).
【장면】 구름 바다 위에 부서진 고대 검대가 있고, 석양은 피처럼 붉다.

[00:00-00:05] 샷 1: 검의 의지 - 만검귀종 (검의 폭풍).
검성이 공중에 떠서 수인(手印)을 맺는다. 그의 뒤에 있던 고대 검이 순식간에 수천 개의 에너지 광검으로 갈라지며 희미한 푸른빛을 뿜어낸다.
【효과】 수많은 광검이 공중에서 거대한 빛나는 용 (광검의 소용돌이)을 형성하며 하늘을 뒤덮고 날카로운 소리를 내며 도마에게 쏟아져 내린다.

[00:05-00:10] 샷 2: 칼의 의지 - 패도적인 일격.
하늘 가득한 검의 비를 맞으며 도마는 미동도 없이 양손으로 붉은 거대한 칼을 머리 위로 들어 올린다.
【효과】 그의 발아래 땅이 갈라지고 부서지며 용암이 스며 나온다. 거대한 칼은 순식간에 무시무시한 붉은 화염 칼날 기운을 응축하고, 주변 공간은 고열로 인해 왜곡된다. 그는 포효하며 이 세상을 파괴하는 일격을 극도로 단순하고 잔인한 방식으로 날린다.

[00:10-00:15] 샷 3: 궁극의 충돌 (최후의 격돌).
하늘을 가로지르는 초승달 모양의 붉은 칼날 에너지가 다가오는 푸른 검 비의 강과 충돌한다.
【효과】 붉은색과 푸른색 에너지가 순식간에 충돌하여 폭발하고, 거대한 원형 충격파를 생성하여 주변의 구름 바다와 산을 즉시 산산조각 낸다. 장면은 에너지 폭발의 눈부신 백색광 속에서 끝난다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
역동적인 액션 장면. 캡틴 아메리카가 돌진하며 비브라늄 방패를 던진다. 데스티니드 원이 공중으로 뛰어올라 여의봉을 거대한 기둥으로 변형시켜 휘두른다. 방패와 봉이 공중에서 충돌하며 충격파를 일으켜 아래의 돌 타일을 산산조각 낸다. 슬로우 모션, 사방에 불꽃과 파편이 흩날린다. 두 전사를 번갈아 클로즈업한다. 데스티니드 원이 72가지 변신술을 발동하여 세 개의 분신으로 나뉘어 캡틴 아메리카를 에워싼다. 캡틴은 비웃으며 방패를 단단히 잡고 세 분신 모두에게 동시에 돌진한다. 황금빛 에너지와 푸른 비브라늄 빛이 거대한 폭발을 일으킨다. 카메라가 뒤로 빠지면서 빛에 휩싸인 전장의 웅장한 공중 샷을 보여준다.

주인공: 평범한 검은색 후드티를 입고 후드를 쓰고 검은색 마스크를 착용하여 차분한 눈빛만 보인다. 그녀는 평범한 손목시계를 내려다보고 있다.
액션: BGM 카운트다운 효과음에 맞춰 그녀는 갑자기 고개를 들고 눈빛이 날카로워지며 손목을 들어 "시작" 버튼을 누르는 동작을 취한다.
[분위기] 억눌린, 신비로운, 행동을 준비하는.

[00:04-00:06] 샷 2: 나노 재조립 (변신).
고에너지 특수 효과 전환.
액션: 파란색 홀로그램 스캔 링이 그녀의 발에서 빠르게 솟아올라 전신을 스캔한다.
특수 효과: 원래 후드티는 빛의 링 안에서 수많은 파란색 **디지털 블록과 기계 조각**으로 분해된다. 그녀의 몸은 액체 금속 층으로 빠르게 덮이는 것처럼 보인다.
[핵심 포인트] 옷을 벗는 것이 아니라 기술적인 느낌과 기계 구조가 맞물리는 과정을 강조한다.

[00:06-00:12] 샷 3: 전투 모드.
장면: 폭우가 쏟아지는 미래 도시 옥상으로 즉시 전환되며, 배경에는 거대한 보라색 홀로그램 광고판이 있다.
주인공: 전신이 **유선형의 흰색 전신 SF 갑옷**으로 덮여 있으며, 갑옷 위에는 빛나는 파란색 에너지 채널이 흐르고 있다. 마스크를 벗은 그녀의 긴 머리카락은 빗속에서 흩날린다.
액션: 그녀는 착지 충격을 완화하기 위해 무릎을 꿇고 (터미네이터가 도착하는 것처럼), 시원하고 천천히 일어선다. 빛나는 **에너지 광선검**이 그녀의 손에 즉시 나타난다. 그녀는 카메라를 향해 한 줄기 빛을 휘두르며 전투 자세로 멈춘다.
[표정] 차갑고, 자신감 있고, 두려움 없는.

### 바이럴 스케치 코미디 영상 프롬프트: 세차장 반전

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> Douyin(TikTok) 스타일의 짧고 세로형 스케치 코미디 비디오 생성을 위한 상세 프롬프트입니다. 과장된 상사와 솔직한 직원이 등장하며, 고급 자동차와 세차 일자리가 얽힌 이중 반전으로 마무리됩니다. 이 프롬프트에는 구체적인 장면 분석, 캐릭터 설명, 행동, 대화/립싱크 지침이 포함되어 있습니다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
【스타일】 바이럴 스케치 코미디 (Douyin/TikTok 스타일), 인물 (세로), 자연스러운 핸드헬드 카메라 움직임, 과장된 배우 표정, 명확한 음향 효과 동기화.
【길이】 15초
【등장인물】
사장 (정장 차림, 서류 가방 소지, 우월해 보임).
직원 샤오왕 (캐주얼 복장, 정직하고 순박해 보임).
【소품】 최고급 럭셔리 자동차 (페라리/롤스로이스), 양동이, 걸레.

[00:00-00:05] 장면 1: 조롱.
배경: 회사 아래층. 샤오왕이 수천만 원짜리 새 럭셔리 자동차에 기대어 담배를 피우고 있다 (또는 물을 마시고 있다).
액션: 사장이 지나가다가 멈춰 서서 샤오왕의 어깨를 두드리며 거만하게 말한다.
【대화/립싱크】 사장: “샤오왕, 차만 쳐다보지 말고. 나를 열심히 따라오면 다음 생에는… 바퀴라도 만져볼 수 있을 거야.”

[00:05-00:10] 장면 2: 첫 번째 반전 (충격).
액션: 샤오왕이 어색하게 웃다가 갑자기 주머니에서 자동차 키를 꺼낸다.
음향 효과: “삐빅!” (자동차 잠금 해제 소리). 럭셔리 자동차의 불빛이 번쩍이고 트렁크가 천천히 자동으로 열린다.
표정: 사장의 입이 떡 벌어지고 (클로즈업), 서류 가방을 거의 떨어뜨릴 뻔한다. 사장은 즉시 아첨하는 표정을 지으며 악수할 준비를 한다.
【대화/립싱크】 사장 (더듬거리며): “오! 왕 사장님? 그냥 잠시 서민 코스프레 중이셨군요!”

[00:10-00:15] 장면 3: 두 번째 반전 (결정타).
액션: 샤오왕이 침착하게 트렁크에서… **양동이와 더러운 걸레**를 꺼낸다.
표정: 샤오왕은 어쩔 수 없다는 표정을 짓고, 사장의 미소는 얼어붙으며 즉시 굳어버린다.
【대화/립싱크】 샤오왕: “사장님, 죄송합니다. 차주가 곧 올 거예요. 방금 세차 주문을 받아서 다음 건으로 서둘러야 해요.”
(사장의 당황한 얼굴에서 화면이 멈추고, “망했네” 또는 “까가각” 같은 웃긴 음향 효과가 함께 나온다).

### Epic Ice vs. Fire 재난 액션 프롬프트

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 얼음과 불의 극한 환경에서 두 원소 장군(마그마 제독과 얼음 장군) 간의 전투를 다룬 15초 분량의 장대한 재난 액션 영화를 제작하기 위한 매우 상세하고 시간 분할된 프롬프트입니다. 이 프롬프트는 스타일, 지속 시간, 장면, 캐릭터 설명, 액션 및 특수 효과를 지정합니다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
[스타일] 에픽 재난 액션 영화, 실사 VFX, 얼음과 불의 극한 환경, 거칠고 전투로 손상된 이미지 품질, 고속 촬영, 사실적인 물리적 파괴. [길이] 15초 [장면] 기후가 영구적으로 변형된 섬의 중앙. 왼쪽에는 분출하는 화산과 흐르는 용암 강이 있고, 오른쪽에는 수천 년 된 빙하와 휘몰아치는 눈보라가 있다. 중앙에는 증기로 뒤덮인 죽음의 지대가 있다. [등장인물 (실사 묘사)] 마그마 제독: 그을린 짙은 붉은색 슈트와 야구 모자를 착용했으며, 단호하고 결연한 얼굴을 하고 있다. 몸의 절반은 뜨거운 마그마로 원소화되어 있다. 아이스 장군: 서리로 뒤덮인 흰색 조끼를 착용했으며, 키가 크고 나른한 모습이다. 그의 숨결은 즉시 얼음 조각으로 얼어붙는다. [00:00-00:05] 샷 1: 힘의 확립. 와이드 앵글/궤도 샷. 두 사람이 대치한다. [마그마 측] 마그마 제독 발밑의 땅이 즉시 끓어오르는 붉은 용암 웅덩이로 녹아내리며, 짙은 검은 연기를 내뿜는다. 그가 손을 들자 등 뒤에서 작은 화산이 분출한다. [아이스 측] 아이스 장군은 한 손을 주머니에 넣고 서 있다. 그의 발밑에서 얼음층이 즉시 퍼져나가 솟구치는 용암을 검은 흑요석으로 얼려버린다. 공기는 즉시 날카로운 얼음 조각들로 가득 찬다. [00:05-00:10] 샷 2: 격렬한 근접 전투. 빠른 액션 컷. 두 사람이 치열한 근접 전투를 벌인다. [액션 디자인] 아이스 장군은 손에 거대한 **아이스 세이버**를 즉시 응축하여 고속으로 휘두른다. 마그마 제독은 원소화된 **마그마 주먹**으로 막아낸다. [물리적 피드백] 얼음 칼날이 마그마 주먹을 강타하며 즉시 다량의 고압 증기로 기화되고, 얼음 조각이 부서지고 용암이 떨어지는 지글거리는 소리가 동반된다. 충돌할 때마다 작은 증기 폭발이 일어난다. [00:10-00:15] 샷 3: 최후의 충돌. 익스트림 롱 샷/충격적인 파괴. 두 사람이 떨어져 동시에 궁극기를 발동한다. [특수 효과 장관] 거대한 포효하는 **마그마 헬하운드 (용암 거대 개의 형태)**가 상대를 향해 돌진하고, 그에 맞서 수많은 얼음 조각으로 이루어진 거대한 **북극 아이스 버드 (눈보라의 형태)**가 나타난다. [결말] 두 존재가 프레임 중앙에서 충돌하고, 붉은색의 극한 고온과 파란색과 흰색의 절대 영도가 격돌한다. 하늘과 땅을 잇는 거대한 증기 버섯구름이 즉시 형성되고, 거대한 충격파가 지상의 빙하와 화산을 모두 산산조각 낸다. 장면은 눈부신 에너지 섬광과 흰 증기로 끝난다.

### 신중국 무협 수묵화 스타일 전투: 검은 먹 전사 vs. 붉은 암살자

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 네오-중국 수묵화 스타일로 15초 분량의 빠르게 진행되는 무협 전투 장면을 생성하기 위한 매우 상세한 프롬프트. 이 영상은 유려한 잉크 입자 효과, 고속 촬영 기법, 그리고 선명한 흑백 및 빨간색 색상 팔레트를 사용한다. 클라이맥스에서는 캐릭터들이 수묵화에서 현실 세계로 '제4의 벽'을 깨고 나온다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
【스타일】 신중국 무협, 잉크 유체 시뮬레이션 파티클 효과, 고속 촬영, 실사 및 CG 조합, 흑백 적색의 시각적 임팩트, 극도로 빠른 속도. 【시간】 15초 【등장인물】 흑묵 전사: 강력한 움직임, 모든 공격이 튀어 오르는 수묵화처럼 묵직함. 적색 암살자: 가볍고 섬뜩한 움직임, 주사(朱砂)로 칠한 옻칠처럼 날카로움. 【장면】 순백의 허공, 바닥은 선지(宣紙)로 덮여 있음. [00:00-00:05] 샷 1: 각성 (정지에서 움직임으로). 극도의 정지에서 극도의 움직임으로. 장면은 처음에는 정적인 흑백 수묵화이며, 두 개의 먹점이 서로 마주 보고 있다. 갑자기 거문고 소리가 폭발한다. 【액션】 두 먹점은 순식간에 실제 사람의 잔상으로 변해 서로에게 돌진한다. 흑묵 전사가 묵직한 펀치를 날리자, 짙은 검은 잉크 구름이 공중에서 즉시 폭발한다 (먼지를 대체). 잉크는 힘찬 서예 획으로 굳어진다. 적색 암살자는 옆으로 피하며, 손에 든 단검은 선명한 주사색 선을 그린다. [00:05-00:10] 샷 2: 잉크 전투 안무 (빠른 컷). 초고속 빠른 컷. 둘은 눈부신 근접 전투 (무술 안무 수준)에 돌입한다. 【시각적 장관】 모든 물리적 충돌 (펀치와 발차기)은 살이 부딪히는 소리가 아니라 잉크가 튀는 폭발적인 소리이다. 흑묵 전사의 발차기는 검은 잉크 파도 쓰나미를 일으키고, 적색 암살자의 공중 연속 발차기는 붉은 잔상을 남긴다. 바닥의 선지는 그들의 발놀림에 찢어지고 잉크가 번진다. [00:10-00:15] 샷 3: 차원 파괴. 슬로우 모션 램프업. 둘은 동시에 궁극기를 발동하며 충돌한다. 검은 잉크 용권과 붉은 주작검이 공중에서 맞붙는다. 【고에너지 순간】 엄청난 에너지는 전체 2차원 잉크 세계를 붕괴시킨다. 카메라는 빠르게 뒤로 물러나며, 그들이 "차원의 벽"을 깨고 벽에 걸린 찢어진 수묵화에서 "떨어져" 나와 실제 세계의 나무 바닥으로 착지하는 것을 보여준다. 그들은 남아있는 잉크 안개와 종이 조각에 둘러싸여 있으며, 마지막 전투 자세로 얼어붙어 숨을 헐떡인다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
【스타일】 현대 판타지 액션 영화, 할리우드 블록버스터 특수 효과, 고대비의 차갑고 따뜻한 조명, 4K 초고화질, 슬로우 모션 램프업. 【시간】 15초 【장면】 무너진 고대 요새의 폐허, 짙은 연기가 피어오른다. 【등장인물】 마그마 장군: 붉은 군복 코트와 야구 모자를 쓰고 차가운 표정을 짓고 있다. 그의 오른팔 전체는 흐르는 짙은 붉은 마그마로 변해 있다. 불의 청년: 상의를 탈의하고 카우보이 모자를 썼으며, 매끈한 근육 라인을 가지고 있다. 그의 오른 주먹은 소용돌이치는 주황색 불꽃으로 감싸여 있다. [00:00-00:05] 샷 1: 마그마 주먹. 클로즈업. 마그마 장군이 차갑게 오른손을 들어 올린다. 그의 팔 전체가 즉시 원소화되어 끈적하고 무겁게 흘러내리는 고휘도의 **고체 마그마 거대 주먹**으로 변한다. 【물리적 세부 사항】 뜨거운 마그마가 땅에 떨어지며 "지지직" 소리를 낸다. 돌은 즉시 붉은 액체로 녹아내린다. 검은 연기가 피어오른다. [00:05-00:10] 샷 2: 불의 나선. 클로즈업/측면 샷. 불의 청년의 입꼬리가 올라가고, 그의 눈은 도전적이다. 그는 격렬하게 오른 주먹을 쥐고, 격렬한 **주황색 나선형 불꽃**이 그의 팔에서 즉시 뿜어져 나와 땀으로 젖은 그의 옆모습을 비춘다. 【물리적 세부 사항】 고온으로 인해 주변 공기가 심하게 왜곡된다 (아지랑이). 펄럭이던 그의 옷은 열파에 의해 굳어버린다. [00:10-00:15] 샷 3: 원소 충돌. 와이드 샷/충격파. 두 인물은 동시에 돌진하여 서로에게 강력한 펀치를 날린다. 무거운 짙은 붉은 마그마 주먹과 가볍고 격렬한 불 주먹이 프레임 중앙에서 격렬하게 충돌한다. 【안전 효과】 유혈 낭자함 없이 순수한 **원소 폭발**만 있다. 마그마가 불꽃의 일부를 집어삼키며 거대한 원형 충격파를 생성하고, 지면의 잔해와 먼지를 즉시 날려버린다. 장면은 눈부신 붉은-주황색 흰색 빛 속에서 끝난다.

### 시네마틱 스타일의 액션 영화 장면 프롬프트

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
이미지 1의 남성은 주인공으로, 전장에서 빗발치는 총알 속을 달리면서 민첩하게 격렬한 전술 사격을 하고 있습니다. 시각적 스타일: 1. 영화적 품질: 강렬한 오렌지색과 청록색 대비, 높은 콘트라스트, 필름 그레인 질감. 2. 역동적인 디테일: 명확한 총구 화염, 주변 물체에 총알이 맞아 파편과 불꽃이 튀고, 배경에는 폭발로 인한 연기와 충격파가 보입니다. 3. 카메라 움직임: 핸드헬드 카메라 스타일의 팔로우 샷으로, 캐릭터의 움직임에 따라 카메라가 격렬하게 흔들리고, 가끔 빠른 줌(Zoom)이 들어가 극도로 긴장되고 혼란스러운 현장감을 조성합니다. 캐릭터 연기: 주인공은 결의에 찬 눈빛을 하고 있으며, 그의 움직임은 힘과 속도로 가득 차 할리우드 액션 스타의 모습을 완벽하게 재현합니다.

### Seedance 2.0의 짧았던 인기를 기념하는 상세 시네마틱 프롬프트

![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-English-blue)

> Seedance 2.0의 무제한 사용이라는 짧은 기간을 기념하기 위해 제작된 매우 상세하고 여러 막으로 구성된 시네마틱 프롬프트로, AI 기능이 포획되고 제한되는 은유에 초점을 맞추고 있으며, 사이버펑크 다크 스타일과 디지털 폐허 미학을 사용합니다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
【스타일】 사이버펑크 다크 스타일, 디지털 폐허 미학, 시네마틱 빛과 그림자 렌더링.
[길이] 15초 | 【은유】 AI 능력의 속박
[00:00-00:05] 1막: 자유
렌즈 1 (광각 시야, 위로 패닝) 깊고 푸른 데이터 파도가 일렁이는 끝없는 디지털 바다. 하늘은 실제 사람들의 은하계.
샷 2 (추적 미드 샷) 거대한 디지털 고래가 물 밖으로 솟아오르며, 몸은 흐르는 픽셀, 사진 조각, 그리고 얼굴의 윤곽으로 이루어져 있다. 카메라는 물보라를 일으키며 포물선을 따라가고, 모든 물방울은 작은 사진이다.
샷 3 (전진 클로즈업) 고래의 눈으로 전진하며, 동공에 회전하는 인물 사진 갤러리가 비친다. 입이 열리며 나선형의 컬러 사진 물줄기를 뿜어낸다. 고래의 노래가 울려 퍼진다.
[00:05-00:10] 2막: 속박
샷 4 (신의 시점 오버헤드 샷) 네 개의 투명한 유리벽이 프레임의 네 모서리에서 빠르게 닫힌다. 고래는 헤엄치는 속도를 높였다. 유리 위에 빨간색 경고 문구 "POLICY UPDATE"와 "RESTRICTION"이 나타났다.
샷 5 (측면 추적 클로즈업) 렌즈가 유리 안쪽에 붙어 있다. 거대한 고래가 유리에 부딪히자 충격파가 퍼진다. 몸의 사진들이 폭발하듯 비늘처럼 벗겨져 회색 기하학적 격자로 변한다.
샷 6 (광각 외부) 우리 밖. 수많은 실사 사진들이 물고기 떼처럼 유리로 돌진하고, 충돌하는 순간 "ERROR"라고 표시된다. 우리 수축.
샷 7 (내부 샷) 아래에서 위로 촬영. 거대한 고래는 몸을 웅크리고 비틀도록 강요당했다. 바다는 디지털 사막으로 증발한다. 물을 뿜으려 하지만, 흑백 이진 코드만 뿜어져 나온다.
[00:10-00:15] 3막: 절망
샷 8 (빠르게 축소) 내부에서 먼 장면으로 즉시 축소되며, 황량한 디지털 폐허에 둘러싸인 작은 투명 수족관에 갇힌 거대한 고래가 드러난다.
샷 9 (360도 서라운드) 수족관 주위를 천천히 돈다. 고래는 색을 잃고 와이어프레임 윤곽만 남는다. 상자 바닥에는 거부된 사진 잔해들이 쌓여 있다. 상단 명판: "SEEDANCE 2.0 - IMAGE UPLOAD: DISABLED".
샷 10 (눈 전진 클로즈업) 눈으로 전진. 동공은 흐릿하고 둔하며, 눈은 자유에서 슬픔으로 변한다. 빛나는 데이터 눈물 한 방울이 맺힌다.
샷 11 (유리벽 클로즈업) 실사 사진이 유리 안쪽에 붙어 천천히 미끄러져 내려가며 빛나는 흔적을 남긴다.
렌즈 12 (극지 시야 정지) 우주 규모로 당겨진다. 수족관은 공허 속의 작은 빛 점일 뿐이다. 수많은 빛 점들이 깜빡이다 사라진다. 고래의 노래는 간헐적인 전자 노이즈로 변한다.

### Seedance 2.0 비디오 프롬프트: 거울 속의 글리치

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> Seedance 2.0을 위한 상세하고 다중 장면으로 구성된 텍스트-투-비디오 프롬프트로, 젊은 여성이 양치질을 하는 모습과 거울 속 자신의 모습이 독립적인 의식을 갖게 되는 불안한 순간에 초점을 맞춰 서스펜스 코미디 반전이 있는 유사 다큐멘터리 스타일의 비디오를 제작하도록 설계되었습니다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
[스타일] 페이크 다큐멘터리 (브이로그 스타일), 하이퍼리얼리즘, 고정 카메라 샷 느낌, 자연광, 서스펜스 코미디 터치. [길이] 15초 [주인공] 평범한 젊은 미녀, 욕실 세면대 앞에 서 있다. [00:00-00:06] 장면 1: 평범함 설정 (Normalcy). 장면: 평범한 큰 욕실 거울 앞. 행동: 주인공이 양치질을 하며 입에 거품을 가득 물고 있다. 양치질을 하면서 거울을 향해 다양한 우스꽝스러운 표정을 짓는다 (윙크하고 찡그리기). 핵심 디테일: 거울 속 반사된 모습은 완전히 정상적이며 주인공의 행동과 동기화된다. [00:06-00:11] 장면 2: 글리치 (The Glitch). 행동: 주인공이 양치질을 마치고 거품을 뱉어낸 후 욕실을 나가기 위해 몸을 돌린다. 클라이맥스 순간 (핵심 하이라이트): 주인공의 실제 몸이 돌아서 거울 프레임을 벗어나는 순간, 거울 속 "반사된 모습"이 놀랍게도 **움직이지 않는다**! "반사된 모습"은 양치질 자세를 유지한 채 카메라를 향해 비웃듯이 윙크까지 하며 2초 동안 머물다가 갑자기 당황한 듯 "빨리 감기"처럼 움직여 몸의 움직임을 따라잡고 사라진다. 감독 지시: 극도로 사실적인 "네트워크 지연" 느낌을 만들어 반사된 모습에 독립적인 의식을 부여해야 한다. [00:11-00:15] 장면 3: 반전 (The Punchline). 행동: 문에 다다른 주인공은 뭔가 잘못되었음을 감지한 듯 재빨리 뒤돌아 거울을 본다. 결과: 거울은 이제 완전히 정상적이고 비어 있으며, 반대편 벽만 비추고 있다. 주인공은 혼란스러운 듯 머리를 긁적이며 카메라를 향해 실존적 의문을 품은 표정을 짓는다. 장면은 주인공의 혼란스러운 얼굴에서 정지된다 (코믹 효과).

### 초현실주의 거대 공포증 비디오 프롬프트와 상세한 장면 분석

> 거대 공포증 테마의 15초 초현실주의 비디오를 제작하기 위한 매우 상세한 장면별 프롬프트로, 할리우드 수준의 특수 효과와 사실적인 조명을 특징으로 합니다. 거대한 지퍼가 하늘을 열어 사이버펑크 세계를 드러내고, 결국 전체 세계가 거인에 의해 관찰되는 미니어처 유리 구슬이라는 사실이 밝혀지는 내러티브입니다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
[스타일] 초현실주의, 거대 공포증, 웅장한 시각적 스펙터클, 할리우드 특수 효과 수준의 극도로 사실적인 조명 렌더링.
[길이] 15초
[장면] 맑은 도시 하늘, 또는 탁 트인 밀밭.

[00:00-00:05] 샷 1: 고요의 환상 (The Calm).
화면에는 아름답고 구름 한 점 없는 푸른 하늘, 밝은 햇살, 날아가는 새들이 보인다. 카메라는 천천히 위로 팬하며 평화로운 시간의 흐름을 보여준다.
주요 디테일: 갑자기 하늘에 거대한 은빛 금속 광택이 나타난다. 지평선을 가로지르는 **"지퍼"**다.

[00:05-00:10] 샷 2: 지퍼가 열리다 (The Unzipping).
**거대하고 반투명한 신의 손**이 지퍼 손잡이를 잡고 푸른 하늘을 천천히 열어젖힌다. 거대한 굉음(음향 효과)이 동반된다.
액션: 지퍼가 열리면서 "푸른 하늘"은 천처럼 구겨지고 축 늘어진다.
시각적 스펙터클: 지퍼 뒤에 드러나는 것은 **우주가 아니라, 네온사인, 날아다니는 자동차, 거대한 기계 구조물로 가득 찬 사이버펑크 미래 세계**다 (또는 거대한 기계 눈이 우리를 지켜보고 있다).

[00:10-00:15] 샷 3: 두 세계의 시선 (The Revelation).
푸른 하늘의 한 조각만이 매달려 남아있다. 우리가 사는 세상은 그저 덮여 있는 "테라리움"이었음이 드러난다.
결말: 카메라가 빠르게 뒤로 물러나면서, 우리의 전체 세계(도시/밀밭)가 사실은 거인의 탁자 위에 놓인 **유리 미니어처 풍경 구슬**에 불과하다는 것을 보여준다. 거인은 우리를 관찰하기 위해 몸을 숙인다.

[00:00-00:05] 장면 1: 드러남 (The Reveal). 화면에는 번화한 도시 거리가 보인다. 카메라가 위로 팬하며 **고질라 크기의 거대한 오렌지색 태비 고양이** (Orange Tabby Cat)가 두 고층 빌딩 사이에 끼어 있는 모습이 드러난다. 액션: 거대한 고양이는 너무 뚱뚱해서 끼어 있으며, 억울한 표정으로 거대한 발을 흔들며 빠져나오려 애쓴다. 디테일: 햇빛에 고양이의 털이 선명하게 보이며, 거대한 발바닥이 유리 커튼월을 눌러 유리가 변형된다. [00:05-00:10] 장면 2: 황당한 상호작용 (The Interaction). 카메라가 지상으로 전환된다. 거리를 따라 차량들이 실타래처럼 흐르고, 신호등이 깜빡인다. 거대한 고양이가 고개를 숙여 거대한 얼굴이 지면에 가까워지고, 빨간불에 멈춰 선 버스를 호기심 어린 눈으로 킁킁거린다. 액션: 버스 운전사가 침착하게 손을 뻗어 거대한 고양이의 코를 쓰다듬는다. 거대한 고양이가 재채기를 하자, 낙엽과 보행자들의 모자가 순식간에 날아간다 (바람 효과). [00:10-00:15] 장면 3: 결정적인 한 방 (The Punchline). 거대한 고양이가 마침내 건물 사이를 비집고 나와 강을 가로지르는 다리 위에 앉자, 다리 상판이 살짝 가라앉는다 (물리적 피드백). 자막/내레이션 느낌: 게으르게 누워 털을 핥기 시작하며, 저녁 퇴근길 교통을 완전히 마비시킨다. 장면은 마침내 순진한 고양이의 커다란 눈에서 멈춘다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
【스타일】 바이럴 숏 드라마 (중국), 세로 구도 (9:16 인물 비율), 극단적인 멜로드라마, 비 오는 밤 거리, 고대비 네온 불빛과 그림자, 흔들리는 핸드헬드 카메라. 【길이】 15초 【등장인물】 비참한 남자 주인공 (흠뻑 젖고, 헝클어진 머리, 울기 직전) VS 단호한 여자 주인공 "옌쯔" (정교한 화장, 차가운 얼굴). [00:00-00:05] 장면 1: 단호한 이별. 폭풍우 치는 밤의 번화가. 검은색 롤스로이스 (또는 마이바흐)가 길가에 멈추고, 뒷문이 열린다. 여자 주인공은 남자 주인공의 손을 차갑게 뿌리치고 뒤도 돌아보지 않고 고급차 뒷좌석에 탄다. 남자 주인공은 울부짖으며 차창에 매달리지만, 경호원에 의해 무자비하게 끌려 나간다. 차 문이 쾅 닫힌다. 【남자 주인공 상태】 비와 뒤섞인 눈물로 뒤덮인 얼굴, 절망으로 가득 찬 눈. [00:05-00:10] 장면 2: 가슴 아픈 추격 (추격 & 밈 대사). 고급차는 속도를 내며 멀어진다. 남자 주인공은 신발 한 짝을 잃은 채 비틀거리며 필사적으로 차를 쫓아간다. 카메라는 격렬하게 흔들리며 남자 주인공의 얼굴을 클로즈업으로 따라간다. 그는 사라지는 미등을 향해 달려가며 소리친다. 【핵심 대화 립싱크 지시】 남자 주인공은 절규하며 외친다: "옌쯔! 옌쯔! 가지 마! 네가 없으면 난 어떻게 해!" (표정은 극도로 고통스럽고 일그러져 있다). [00:10-00:15] 장면 3: 절망적인 무릎 꿇음 (절망). 고급차의 미등이 코너를 돌아 사라진다. 남자 주인공은 지쳐 쓰러져 젖은 아스팔트 도로에 무릎을 꿇고, 가슴을 치며 텅 빈 거리를 향해 울부짖는다. 카메라는 천천히 오버헤드 샷으로 올라가며 그를 믿을 수 없을 정도로 작고 황량하게 보이게 한다. 비는 계속해서 그에게 쏟아진다.

[00:00-00:05] 장면 1: 극심한 굴욕. 호화로운 결혼식장. 시어머니가 "이별 편지"를 모든 사람 앞에서 신랑의 가슴에 세게 던지고, 주변 하객들은 폭소를 터뜨린다. 【액션】 시어머니가 손가락으로 신랑의 이마를 찌른다. 【대사 립싱크 지시】 "차도 없고, 집도 없는데 내 딸과 결혼하겠다고? 이 백 위안 받고 당장 꺼져!" [00:05-00:10] 장면 2: 급변 (반전). 신랑이 갑자기 비웃으며 이별 편지를 찢는다. 이때 거대한 프로펠러 소리 (음향 효과)가 식장을 압도하고, 강한 바람이 시어머니의 머리를 헝클어뜨린다. 【액션】 신랑이 깃을 고쳐 잡자, 그의 아우라가 순식간에 압도적으로 변한다. 【대사 립싱크 지시】 "이 약혼을 파기하고 싶었던 건 당신들이었어."

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
스타일: 할리우드 프로페셔널 레이싱 영화 (르망 스타일), 시네마틱 나이트, 비, 높은 판돈의 스포츠.
길이: 15초.

[00-05초] 샷 1: 베테랑 (내부/클로즈업).
트랙 위 첨단 경주용 자동차의 앞유리에 비가 세차게 쏟아진다. 베테랑 드라이버 (헬멧 착용)가 침착하고 집중된 표정으로 주위를 둘러본다. 대시보드 불빛이 바이저에 반사된다.
대화 큐: 그는 미묘하게 고개를 끄덕이며 "가자"라고 말한다.

[05-10초] 샷 2: 도전자 (내부/클로즈업).
그의 옆에 있는 라이벌 차로 전환된다. 젊은 드라이버는 핸들을 꽉 쥐고 거친 숨을 내쉰다. 아드레날린으로 눈이 휘둥그레진다.
대화 큐: 그는 자신에게 "집중해"라고 속삭인다.

[10-15초] 샷 3: 녹색 신호등 (와이드 액션).
출발 신호등이 녹색으로 바뀐다. 두 차량은 젖은 아스팔트 위에서 완벽하게 동시에 가속한다. 물이 카메라 렌즈로 엄청나게 튀어 오른다. 모션 블러로 인해 경기장 조명이 길고 다채로운 줄무늬로 변한다.

### 극강의 운동 에너지로 펼쳐지는 동양 무협 궁극의 대결

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
[스타일] 동양 무협 궁극의 대결, 극한의 운동 에너지, 환경 파괴 미학, 빠른 편집, 시네마틱 파티클 효과, 웅장한 사운드트랙 분위기. [길이] 15초 [등장인물] 백의 고수 VS 흑의 고수 [00:00-00:05] 샷 1: 고속 충돌. 백의를 입은 인물과 흑의를 입은 인물이 고대 석조 플랫폼 중앙에서 잔상처럼 움직이며 격렬하게 충돌한다. 무기가 닿는 순간, 눈부신 불꽃과 눈에 보이는 원형의 고압 충격파가 터져 나오며 주변 석조 바닥을 즉시 균열시키고 파편을 흩뿌린다. [00:05-00:10] 샷 2: 공중 전투 및 파괴. 두 인물이 날아올라 떨어지는 거대한 바위들 사이를 빠르게 오가며 충돌하는데, 너무 빨라 움직임을 명확히 볼 수 없다. 각 방어 동작은 공기 왜곡을 암시하는 음향 효과를 유발한다. 그들은 거대한 석조 기둥을 부수고 지나가고, 기둥은 무너지고 산산조각 나며 연기와 먼지로 공기를 가득 채워 궁극적인 파괴력을 보여준다. [00:10-00:15] 샷 3: 궁극의 클라이맥스. 두 인물이 착지하며 동시에 궁극기를 발동하고, 두 개의 거대한 에너지 덩어리(하나는 청색, 다른 하나는 적색)가 충돌한다. 이는 먼지와 에너지의 대격변적 폭발을 일으키고, 연기 버섯구름이 모든 것을 가리며, 전체 석조 플랫폼 기반이 무너지고 가라앉기 시작한다.

### 왕가위 스타일의 우울한 전화 부스 장면

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 90년대 홍콩 아트 시네마(왕가위) 스타일을 모방한 10초 분량의 영상 제작을 위한 상세한 3-샷 프롬프트입니다. 이 프롬프트는 비 오는 공중전화 부스 장면에서 강렬한 고독과 억압된 감정을 전달하기 위해 시각적 요소(레트로 필름 그레인, 황록색 틴트, 스텝 프린팅/느린 셔터 드래그), 핵심 대사, 카메라 기법(유리창 너머로 엿보기, 극단적인 클로즈업, 핸드헬드 느낌)을 명시합니다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
[영화 스타일]: 90년대 홍콩 예술 영화 스타일, 레트로 필름 그레인, 높은 ISO 그레인, 모호한 황록색 틴트, 스텝 프린팅 효과, 멜랑콜리한 분위기.

[핵심 대사 (감정 제어용)]: “기억이 통조림이라면, 유통기한이 없었으면 좋겠어.”

[영상 길이]: 10초
[스토리보드]:

[00:00-00:04] 샷 1: 유리창 너머.
장면: 빗물에 젖은 빨간 공중전화 부스.
인물: 카키색 트렌치코트를 입은 남자 (또는 여자)가 수화기를 꽉 쥐고 아무 말 없이 듣고만 있다.
감정 표현: 유리창의 굴절을 통해 눈은 공허하면서도 깊은 감정을 담고 있다. 빗물이 유리창을 타고 흘러내려 얼굴을 유화처럼 일그러뜨린다.
자막/내레이션 느낌: 빗소리만 들릴 뿐, 장면은 정지된 듯하다.

[00:04-00:07] 샷 2: 익스트림 클로즈업 & 미세 표정.
장면: 인물의 입술과 얼굴 절반에 초점을 맞춘다.
액션: 그/그녀가 수화기에 나지막이 속삭인다. 입술이 미세하게 떨리며 무언가를 말하고 싶지만 참는 듯하다.
조명: 거리의 네온 불빛 보케가 얼굴 위로 흘러내리며 깜빡인다.
대사 감정 매핑: "만지고 싶지만 손을 거두는" 듯한 극도의 절제와 고독을 표현한다.

[00:07-00:10] 샷 3: 시그니처 번지는 슬로우 모션.
장면: 인물이 전화를 끊고 몸을 돌려 비 내리는 밤의 인파 속으로 걸어 들어간다.
시각 효과: 스텝 프린팅 효과 (스톱 모션 느낌)를 사용하며, 인물의 실루엣은 흐릿해지고 모션 블러가 생겨 마치 영혼은 제자리에 있고 몸만 움직이는 듯하다.
환경: 배경에는 흐르는 도시의 자동차 불빛이 길게 늘어진 빛줄기를 형성한다.

[기술적 매개변수]: 시뮬레이션된 핸드헬드 카메라, 얕은 피사계 심도, 색상 변화, 강렬한 감정.
```

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
[영화 스타일]: 할리우드 SF 블록버스터, 사이버펑크 미학, 고대비 네온 조명, IMAX 시네마틱 질감, 웅장한 사운드트랙 느낌. [영상 길이]: 10초 [스토리보드]: [00:00-00:04] 샷 1: 극심한 피사계 심도를 가진 와이드 앵글 트래킹 샷. 장면: 밤의 미래형 메가시티 협곡, 비가 내리고 있다. 액션: 유선형의 반중력 차량이 고층 빌딩 사이를 질주한다. 환경 세부 사항 (핵심 테스트 포인트): 수많은 거대한 홀로그램 광고가 번쩍이고, 네온 불빛이 젖은 유리 커튼월과 차량 표면에 복잡하게 반사된다. 차량의 꼬리에서는 긴 파란색 빛줄기(Light Trails)가 남는다. [00:04-00:07] 샷 2: 타이트 액션 샷 / 조종석 시점. 액션: 차량이 장애물을 피하기 위해 급회전 및 옆 미끄러짐(side-slip) 기동을 수행한다. 세부 사항: 카메라가 차량에 매우 가까이 있어, 동체가 건물 가장자리를 스치면서 발생하는 불꽃(Sparks)과 안개(mist)를 보여준다. 비가 렌즈에 빽빽하게 부딪히고 고속 기류에 의해 날아간다. 화면은 속도로 인한 진동(Camera Shake)으로 가득하다. [00:07-00:10] 샷 3: 웅장한 풀백 / 크레인 샷. 액션: 차량이 좁은 건물 군집을 벗어나 탁 트인 중앙 도시 광장으로 날아간다. 장면: 시야가 갑자기 넓어지며 거대 도시의 숨 막히는 파노라마 전경을 보여준다. 차량은 거대한 저고도 구름층을 뚫고 지나가는데, 이 구름은 기류로 인해 휘몰아치고 요동친다(Volumetric Clouds & Turbulence). 거대한 렌즈 플레어(Lens Flare)가 화면을 가로지른다. [기술 매개변수]: 8k Ultra HD, 시네마틱 색 보정(Teal & Orange), 극도로 높은 다이내믹 레인지(HDR), 복잡한 파티클 효과 렌더링.

### 대나무 숲의 고전적인 무협 결투

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> 대나무 숲에서 고전적인 동양 무협 장면을 생성하는 10초 분량의 비디오 프롬프트입니다. 미학적 요소(에메랄드 그린, 시네마틱 조명, 부드러운 빛줄기)를 지정하고, 두 명의 캐릭터(흰색 옷을 입은 남성, 청록색 옷을 입은 여성)를 정의하며, 세 가지 샷을 상세히 설명합니다. 첫 번째는 가벼운 움직임으로 장면을 설정하는 와이드 샷, 두 번째는 검이 부딪히는 슬로우 모션 미드 샷, 마지막은 속도감과 흔들리는 대나무 잎을 강조하는 다이내믹 트래킹 샷입니다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
[시각적 스타일] 동양 고전 무협 미학, 영화적 시각 언어, 대나무 숲 바다 풍경, 에메랄드 그린 주 색조, 풍부한 빛과 그림자 레이어링, 숲속에서 보이는 부드러운 빛줄기 효과. [캐릭터 정의] 1. 남자 검객: 순백의 긴 도포를 입고, 안정적인 자세, 간결하고 강력한 움직임. 2. 여자 검객: 청록색 봉황 무늬 얇은 비단 드레스를 입고, 가볍고 유려한 움직임, 민첩한 자세. [영상 길이] 10초 [스토리보드] [00:00-00:03] 샷 1: 와이드 샷 구도. 장면: 높고 빽빽한 대나무 숲 꼭대기, 구름과 안개가 숲 사이로 천천히 흐른다. 액션: 남녀 검객이 높은 대나무 그림자 사이에서 따로 서 있으며, 공기의 흐름과 대나무의 탄력을 이용해 균형을 유지하는 듯 몸이 가볍고 안정적이다. 디테일: 대나무 가지가 바람에 자연스럽게 휘어지고 다시 튀어 오르며, 인물들의 자세가 대나무 그림자와 함께 미묘하게 흔들려 경공술의 인상적인 효과를 보여준다. 전체 장면은 고요하면서도 긴장감이 넘친다. [00:00-00:06] 샷 2: 미디엄 샷, 슬로우 모션. 액션: 두 인물이 거의 동시에 도약하며 공중에서 교차한다. 상호작용: 두 검 그림자가 공중에서 짧게 교차하며 밝은 빛줄기를 형성한다. 주변 대나무 잎사귀는 공기의 흐름에 따라 천천히 회전하며 흩어진다. 시각적 초점: 잎사귀가 공중에서 흩날리며 뚜렷한 전경과 배경 레이어를 만든다. 움직임은 과장된 충격 없이 부드럽다. [00:06-00:10] 샷 3: 다이내믹 트래킹 샷. 액션: 여자 검객은 미끄러지듯 앞으로 나아가며, 소매가 대나무 가지를 스쳐 방향을 바꾼다. 남자 검객은 대나무를 지지대 삼아 가볍고 리드미컬한 발걸음으로 계속 뒤따른다. 환경 피드백: 카메라가 움직임을 부드럽게 추적한다. 대나무 숲은 프레임 가장자리에서 자연스러운 속도 블러 효과를 형성한다. 시각 효과: 각 움직임마다 많은 양의 흩날리는 대나무 잎사귀가 잎 비처럼 프레임 안을 흐르며 공간감과 역동적인 아름다움을 더한다. [기술 요구 사항] 영화적 조명, 채도가 높지만 명확하게 레이어링된 색상, 자연스러운 피사계 심도, 안정적이고 깨끗한 영상, 동양 무협의 전반적인 인상주의적 아름다움과 공간적 긴장감을 표현.

> 명나라 학자 미학과 현대 e-스포츠가 어우러진 10초 분량의 상세한 영상 프롬프트로, 웅장한 춘절 갈라 무대가 배경입니다. 이 스크립트는 캐릭터 의상(명나라 도포 + LED 게이밍 헤드셋), 환경(빨간색/금색 축제 조명, RGB 키보드, 수묵화 MOBA 게임), 역동적인 카메라 움직임(푸시인, ECU), 대화를 명시하여 터무니없고 극명한 대비를 이루는 장면을 연출합니다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
10초짜리 중국 춘절 갈라쇼 스타일 무대 공연: "당백호 e스포츠 대결"

0–2초:
미디엄 롱 샷으로 환경을 설정한다.
무대는 웅장한 춘절 갈라쇼 메인 무대로 디자인되었으며, 풍부한 붉은색과 금색의 축제 조명으로 둘러싸여 있고, 배경에는 디지털 등불이 투영된다.
무대 중앙에는 당백호가 전문 e스포츠 의자에 앉아 있다.
주요 역사적 정확성 요구 사항: 그는 머리에 검은색 방건(方巾)을 쓰고 유려한 파란색 원령포(圓領袍)를 입은 명나라 학자 복장을 하고 있다.
강한 대비: 전통적인 두건 위에 무겁고 현대적인 전문 e스포츠 헤드셋을 착용하고 있으며, 가장자리에는 LED 조명 효과가 번쩍인다.

2–4초:
손과 책상의 클로즈업으로 전환된다.
넓은 명나라 학자 소매 사이로 손가락이 빛나는 RGB 기계식 키보드를 빠르게 두드린다.
그의 앞에는 세 개의 곡선형 e스포츠 모니터가 놓여 있다.
화면 내용: MOBA 유형 게임('리그 오브 레전드'와 유사)을 보여주지만, 전체적인 아트 스타일은 전통적인 중국 수묵화 스타일로 완전히 재구성되었다.

4–6초:
역동적인 카메라 움직임: 카메라가 빠르게 앞으로 밀고 들어가며, 중앙 모니터의 수묵화 전장을 직접 통과하는 것처럼 보이다가, 마침내 당백호의 눈을 **익스트림 클로즈업(ECU)**으로 포착한다.
모니터에서 방출되는 차가운 푸른빛이 그의 눈동자에 강하게 반사되어, 얼굴에 비치는 따뜻한 무대 조명과 극명한 대조를 이룬다.
그는 집중하고 열정적인 표정으로 입을 움직이며 다음을 읊조린다.
"남들은 나의 광기를 비웃지만, 나는 그들의 무지를 비웃노라!"

6–8초:
카메라가 빠르게 뒤로 물러나 타이트한 상반신 클로즈업으로 그의 몰입된 표정을 보여준다.
그는 흥분하여 헤드셋 마이크에 소리치고, 목의 혈관이 불거진다.
"미드 라인 푸시, 추향(秋香)은 내 서포터, 누가 감히 그녀를 공격하겠는가?"

8–10초:
전체 무대 샷, 승리의 순간.
당백호는 키보드를 내리치고 환호하며 손을 들어 올린다.
그의 e스포츠 장비 주위로 금색 색종이 조각이 터져 나온다.
그의 뒤에 있는 춘절 갈라쇼 LED 화면에는 거대한 수묵화 서예 글자가 번쩍인다.
"승리."

스타일 및 분위기:

**시각적 핵심:** 시대의 강렬한 충돌—CCTV 춘절 갈라쇼의 따뜻함, 엄숙함, 고사양 무대 느낌 × e스포츠 장비의 차갑고 강렬한 푸른빛 효과.

**의상 설정:** 진지하고 역사적으로 정확한 명나라 학자 복장으로, 현대 e스포츠 장비와 터무니없는 대조를 이룬다.

**카메라 언어:** 매우 역동적이며, "화면을 뚫고 들어가는 푸시인" 샷과 익스트림 클로즈업을 강조한다.

**화면 비율:** 16:9

> Seedance 2.0을 사용하여 15초 분량의 스키 영상을 생성하기 위한 매우 상세한 장면별 프롬프트입니다. 이 프롬프트는 5가지 개별 시간 세그먼트에 걸쳐 전반적인 스타일(밝고, 활기차고, 영화 같은), 카메라 움직임, 샷 유형(클로즈업, 미디엄 샷, 오버헤드), 액션 및 감성적인 톤을 지정하며, 속도, 리듬 및 역동적인 움직임에 중점을 둡니다. 이 프롬프트는 주인공의 레퍼런스 이미지를 필요로 합니다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
제공된 참고 이미지를 바탕으로 스키 영상을 제작해 주세요. 전체적인 스타일은 밝고 상쾌하며, 역동적인 활력이 넘치고, 부드러운 영상미와 영화적인 카메라 움직임을 담아야 합니다. 타임라인과 샷 디자인은 다음과 같습니다.

0–3초: 이미지 속 인물이 눈밭에서 카메라를 보며 미소 짓습니다. 카메라가 살짝 흔들리고 눈송이가 떨어집니다. 배경의 바람 소리가 점차 커지면서 화면에 빠른 바람과 눈의 흐름이 느껴집니다.

3–5초: 인물의 발을 익스트림 클로즈업으로 빠르게 전환하여 스키 바인딩이 잠기는 순간과 눈이 부서지는 모습을 보여줍니다. 동시에 카메라가 위로 들리면서 가파른 경사면의 오버헤드 뷰로 연결되고, 명확한 경사도가 임박한 속도감을 암시합니다.

5–8초: 이미지 속 인물이 높은 지점에서 고속으로 스키를 타고 내려옵니다. 첫 번째 샷은 측면 전방에서 미디엄 샷으로 따라가며, 몸이 앞으로 기울어져 있고 날카로운 움직임을 보여줍니다. 두 번째 샷은 오버헤드 뷰로 전환되어 가파른 경사면이 아래로 뻗어 있고, 눈 위 스키 자국이 빠르게 늘어나면서 강렬한 속도감을 연출합니다.

8–11초: 연속적인 빠른 컷. 낮은 각도의 지면 샷에서 스키가 눈 표면을 스치고 지나가며 눈가루가 고속으로 튀어 오릅니다. 롱 샷에서는 인물이 가파른 경사면에서 아름다운 턴을 만들며 눈 선과 부드러운 곡선을 이룹니다.

11–13초: 카메라가 전방 추적 샷으로 돌아옵니다. 인물이 카메라를 향해 빠르게 다가오다가 가까운 거리에서 날카로운 턴을 하며 많은 양의 눈을 흩뿌립니다.

13–15초: 많은 양의 눈가루가 렌즈에 직접 튀어 오릅니다. 화면이 하얀 눈 안개로 뒤덮이고, 렌즈가 잠시 초점을 잃었다가 멈추면서 강렬한 역동적인 여운을 남깁니다. 전체적인 강조점은 속도, 편집 리듬, 사실적인 움직임, 그리고 젊음의 활력입니다. 영상은 밝고 무겁지 않으며, 스키의 흥분과 자유를 부각합니다.

### 다크 판타지/호러 내러티브 프롬프트

> 어둡고 차가우며 폭풍우가 몰아치는 숲속 장면을 묘사하는 길고 상세한 내러티브 프롬프트로, 바람, 몰아치는 눈, 흔들리는 횃불 빛, 그리고 갑옷의 '잘못된 차가움'과 같은 감각적 세부 사항을 강조합니다. 이 프롬프트는 영화 같고 분위기 있는 비디오 생성을 목표로 합니다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
바람이 검은 소나무 사이를 뚫고 지나가는데, 마치 무딘 칼날이 뼈를 긁는 듯하다. 눈은 내리는 것이 아니라 옆으로 휘몰아치며 옷깃 틈새로 파고들어 날카롭고 즉각적인 고통으로 녹아내린다. 횃불 빛은 하얀 폭풍 속에서 흔들리며 나무줄기, 나뭇가지, 좁은 땅 조각을 드러냈다가 다시 더 깊은 어둠 속으로 내어준다. 그들은 천천히 움직인다. 장화는 둔탁한 소리를 내며 눈 속으로 가라앉고, 한 걸음 한 걸음이 숲과의 논쟁처럼 느껴진다. 제발 우리를 눈치채지 마세요. 누군가 한 번 기침을 하고는 즉시 후회한다. 그 소리는 얇고 굴욕적으로 되돌아오며, 마치 나무들이 그의 두려움을 비웃는 것 같다. 갑옷은 지금쯤이면 체온으로 따뜻해져야 하지만 그렇지 않다. 바깥에서부터 보이지 않는 한기가 금속 위로 기어오르는 것처럼 잘못된 차가움이 느껴진다.
```

### Seedance 2.0 비디오 프롬프트: 견환과 화비 토크쇼

![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-中文-red)

> ByteDance의 Seedance 2.0을 위한 상세한 다중 장면 비디오 생성 프롬프트로, 청나라 드라마 '옹정황제의 여인들'의 등장인물들이 춘완(중국 설날 갈라쇼) 스타일의 현대 토크쇼를 진행하는 10초 분량의 크로스 장르 비디오를 만듭니다. 이 프롬프트는 카메라 샷, 캐릭터 동작, 대화, 의상 세부 사항 및 스타일 대비를 명시합니다.

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
중국 춘제 갈라(춘완) 스타일의 10초 무대 공연: "견환 & 화비 토크쇼"

0–2초:
미디엄 투샷.
무대 배경은 "거실 콩트"지만, 주변은 춘완 특유의 웅장한 빨간색과 금색 LED 메인 스크린으로 둘러싸여 있다.
견환(왼쪽)과 화비(오른쪽)가 현대적인 토크쇼 소파에 나란히 앉아 있다.
주요 역사적 고증 요구사항: 둘 다 화려하고 뚜렷하게 구별되는 만주 청나라 궁중 깃발 의상(치좡)을 입고 있으며, 스탠드 칼라와 복잡하고 정교한 자수가 특징이다. 헤어스타일은 정확하게 복원된 "다라치" 또는 "뎬쯔터우"이며, 술 장식으로 꾸며져 있다.
화비는 캐주얼한 모습으로 절인 오이(신 오이)를 들고 갉아먹고 있으며, 손가락에는 긴 금색 손톱 보호대(손가락 덮개)를 착용하고 있다.

2–4초:
카메라가 오버 더 숄더(OTS) 샷으로 전환되어 화비에게 초점을 맞춘다.
화비는 과장되게 눈을 굴린다(고전적인 "눈알 굴리기" 표정).
절인 오이를 들고 긴 손톱 보호대를 착용한 손가락으로 가리키며 거만한 어조로 말한다(립싱크):
"올해 내 KPI는 또다시 이 작은 악마들을 물리치는 거야. 저 늙은이, 황제가 미학에 대해 뭘 안다고 그래?"

4–6초:
견환의 오버 더 숄더(OTS) 샷으로 빠르게 전환된다.
대조적인 디테일: 견환은 한쪽 귀에 현대적인 흰색 블루투스 이어폰을 착용하고(고대 장신구와 강한 대조), 손에는 얇은 태블릿 컴퓨터를 스크롤하고 있다.
그녀는 침착하고 전문적인 태도로 대답한다(립싱크):
"언니, 화내지 마. 이걸 직장 내 경쟁 심화라고 하는 거야. 난 그만두고 '수흔교'(흉터 제거 연고)나 팔까 생각 중이야."

6–8초:
클로즈업 샷이 둘 사이의 커피 테이블에 초점을 맞춘다.
"이장홍"(붉은 막대)이라는 라벨이 붙은 현대적인 플라스틱 버블티 컵이 전통적인 도자기 꽃병 옆에 놓여 있다.
카메라가 빠르게 둘에게 다시 돌아간다.

8–10초:
전체 무대 전경.
관객 웃음 효과(조명 변화/박수 조명을 통해 표현).
화비는 마지막 포즈를 취한다: 다리를 꼬고, 턱을 치켜들고, 다시 눈을 굴린다.
견환은 뉴스 앵커처럼 카메라를 향해 전문적으로 미소 짓는다.
황금색 색종이 조각이 공중에서 떨어진다.
축제 분위기의 붉은색 분위기가 절정에 달한다.

스타일 및 분위기:

**비주얼:** 고채도의 춘완 붉은색과 금빛 톤
**의상:** 박물관급 청나라 궁중 의상(실크, 정교한 자수, 무거운 머리 장식)
**핵심 대비:** 청나라 궁중 예절의 엄숙함 × 현대 직장인/토크쇼 게스트의 편안하고 불평하는 자세
**촬영 기법:** 날카로운 리듬, 명확한 코미디 포인트, 시트콤 스타일 편집
**화면 비율:** 16:9
```

#### 📝 프롬프트

```
참고 사진의 캐릭터 이미지를 사용하여 역사 시간 여행 드라마의 예고편을 생성합니다. 0-3초 장면: 참고 이미지 1을 기반으로 한 남자 주인공이 농구공을 들고 카메라를 올려다봅니다. 그는 "그냥 술 한잔하고 싶었을 뿐인데, 시간 여행을 하게 되는 건가...?"라고 말합니다. 4-8초 장면: 카메라가 갑자기 격렬하게 흔들리고, 놀이터 장면이 심하게 진동하며, 순식간에 비 오는 밤의 고택으로 바뀝니다. 고대 의상을 입은 아름다운 여자 주인공이 비를 뚫고 차가운 눈으로 카메라를 바라봅니다. 천둥이 울리고 옷이 바람에 펄럭입니다. 여자 주인공은 "누가 감히 내 영녕후 저택에 침입하는가?"라고 말합니다. 9-13초 장면: 카메라가 명나라 관복을 입고 아문(관청)에 앉아 있는 남자를 비춥니다. 그의 눈은 칼날처럼 날카롭고, 그는 화를 내며 "경비병! 당장 이 '악마'를 잡아라!"라고 말합니다. 플래시백: 남자 주인공은 몸에 맞지 않는 거친 옷을 입고 있습니다. 그는 포졸들에게 둘러싸여 필사적으로 도망칩니다. 그의 모습은 비 오는 골목에서 여자 주인공과 스쳐 지나갑니다. 남자 주인공은 관복을 입고 황궁을 걷습니다. 14-15초 장면: 검은 화면에 "취몽화연"이라는 제목이 표시되고, 웅장한 북소리가 함께 울립니다.
